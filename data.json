Content from 7percent-manifesto.md Title: 7percent Manifesto URL Source: https://www.7pc.vc/7percent-manifesto Markdown Content: In the next 10 years, multi-trillion dollar industries will become completely unrecognizable, entirely new sectors will emerge, and global behemoths will be toppled. The rise of geopolitical instability and increasingly rapid technological progress will define how we live. And the challenges presented by significant inflection points in areas from AI and robotics to climate change and international conflict will transcend the scale of individual nations. ‍Text: Global Economic Policy Uncertainty., URL: https://www.policyuncertainty.com/ Strategic missteps made during a golden age of neoliberalism have led to a world that, while economically more productive, remains critically imbalanced. In many ways, we have been borrowing from the future. Asymmetric warfare is giving way to a potential return of great-power competition as the free world faces constant gray-zone provocations from Moscow and Beijing. A future major war has become part of the drumbeat of news in a way not seen for 50 years. Cost of goods in the developed world is too often subsidized by the low wages and poor working conditions of the least well-off in developing countries. Intensive production of commodities, from energy supply and semiconductors to pharmaceuticals and coffee, are in many cases environmentally devastating. Often their centralized nature also represents a major supply chain risk. Our lack of top-down technocratic planning and politicians devoid of competent statecraft has seen a systematic loss of leadership by Western democracies in developing countries and allowed bad state actors to take advantage of almost universally naive foreign policy. Supply chains and frontier technologies that will be foundational to industries of the future have been underinvested in. While the United States and Europe should not be underestimated when it comes to industrial potential or technological depth, when compared to China’s command-and-control capitalism, 5 year plans and a pro-active expansion of their sphere of influence via their Belt and Road initiative - or bridge and tunnel as we prefer to call it - any truly coherent strategy to counterbalance these moves, at national or supra-national level between the traditional international Allies, has been absent. The organizations of democratic societies - governments and large corporations - are poorly equipped to adapt to and adopt the technologies which will protect them and promote future prosperity. Society tends to view technological change as gradual. But it is the step-change technologies of the last 100 years which define how we live today, the once in a generation scientific discoveries which become commercial products, that produce breakthroughs for humanity. The jet engine has made anywhere on the planet accessible within a day’s travel. Semiconductors and microchips have enabled everything from cellphones to rapid DNA sequencing. The space economy has birthed GPS and instant global communications from the palm of your hand, anywhere - the internet provides more human beings with unlimited information than have access to clean drinking water. So it is “deep tech” which can help us fix the big problems of today by providing security and enabling greater resilience for commerce, health and even political stability. By driving progress in key technological areas we can reduce future uncertainty. It is a coordinated, dynamic approach to the development of the cutting edge technology that will realize civilization-level change for the better. The best companies are often born in the struggle of a downturn, by founders and technologists with their backs against the wall. These startups need patient capital. Science risk is the job of universities, research laboratories and corporate R&D labs. Commercial engineering risk is the role of deep tech investors; to back the founding teams who can accelerate new technology from a proof of concept to a product or service which can change the world for the better. The future will be different to today... ---------------------------------------- For the past 10 years, as individuals and subsequently as a team, 7percent has been investing in frontier technologies and solutions which transform laggard markets. We have four core themes, all essential to provide technological resilience and maintain leadership for the free world. We strive to be where the hockey puck is going, focused on backing technology which will create new markets, or transform the old. Text: Interstellar Labs, URL: https://www.7pc.vc/portfolio/interstellar-lab builds biospheres to grow specialist plants or plants in adverse conditions on Earth, which can also be used to feed those living in future on the Moon, or Mars. Future Compute As we trend toward an end for Moore’s law, there is a new generation of computing architectures that, just in time for the extreme demands of artificial intelligence, will provide a step change in compute speed, processing capacity and energy efficiency.Demand for compute cycles is increasing at more than 10% year-on-year. While AI represents an inevitable challenge for society, whether fake news, financial scams or robots gone rogue, those who lead this revolution will get to set the regulations and ensure our safety. Though we believe we’re still many years from a general AI - something which can pass the Turing test - its rapid advance is inevitable. As they say in Hollywood, you ain’t seen nothin’ yet.‍ ‍Defense and dual use‍ Drastically cheaper launch and the ability to return goods, people and even asteroid mined minerals easily from space, will accelerate the new space economy. Once Space-X’s Starship comes fully online, the growth of the in-space economy will be faster than most thought likely. And those who control space, control planet Earth. Along with democratization of access to data from satellites, and an explosion of - often - decentralized content and sensor data from edge devices, we’ll see big changes in our ability to detect and analyze everything from immigration, to the environment, to the battlefield. As advanced technology becomes cheaper and easier to deploy, the ability for aggressors to take on an opponent with high-tech expensive weaponry, will change the dynamics of war. Very soon reconnaissance drones will be almost invisible, the size of insects. It's already possible for someone to adapt a virus with equipment that would fit in a regular garage. While our focus has shifted to China’s aspirations for Taiwan and Russian expansionism, we probably haven’t seen the end of terrorism from radical religious groups. Technology will help us prevent future terrorist attacks and stronger sovereign defense capabilities can help deter state aggressors.‍‍ ‍Smart Planet‍ The accelerating pace of climate change is underlining the need for technologies that can replace fossil fuels providing greener energy and to decarbonize our global supply chain, the way we build and transport goods as well as people.Technologies will emerge to provide transportation with less environmental impact and lower cost. From electric aviation and point to point mobility, to next gen nuclear and fusion power, we’re due a commercial breakthrough to help correct the damage the industrial revolution has wrought. Buildings and building materials have changed only iteratively the last 150 years since the invention of steel. As new, stronger, greener materials arrive, we should see construction costs fall and green credentials rise. Smart building should be a thing - from the detection of health problems in a building sewage output, through to active heat management. Humantech We’re approaching a tipping point in quantified self. With basic wearables now ubiquitous - smart watches, fitness gadgets, sleep and glucose monitoring - more advanced health and wellness devices will provide an unprecedented amount of data, building on the basics of step count and blood oxygen levels and extending to constant non-invasive health monitoring and brain control interfaces which can help with pain relief, support mental health, or simply read our thoughts so we don’t have to swipe and type. These technologies are already in development. This granular biometric data and the next generation consumer interfaces will redefine the human experience, both how we interact with our own body and the world around us. Timing is everything. --------------------- It’s relatively easy to predict the broad trajectory of future technologies, it is timing that is the nemesis of investors. This is how we think about whether a new technology is ready to be scaled by a startup and change the world. In 1940, vehicle manufacturer Henry Ford predicted that; \"Mark my word: a combination airplane and motorcar is coming. You may smile, but it will come.” Many futurists also predicted that we’d have colonized Mars by now. ‍People are everything. Great startups are often led by highly competent generalists - or specialists who have become generalists - who are able to hire and retain extraordinary people. The leadership of these startups often have a specific insight about a problem and solution which others have overlooked or don’t believe. They then scale with cross-disciplinary teams, hiring the best in the world.‍ No hammers in search of nails. Technology must solve a specific problem. Too often technology is built which is then in search of a market or a problem. Much better to set out to solve a very large problem and identify, deploy or co-opt technology which will solve that problem 10x better than anyone else.‍ Rate of change. Deeptech is driven by a scientific advancement that a startup can translate into a commercially viable technology, or deploy known technology in a new way into a very large, existing laggard market. The product or service must deliver a step change in capability, rather than incremental progress.‍ Patience required. New technology often requires extensive work to commercialize. Startups require investors who will drive urgency but recognise that engineering can take time. Startups must have a cap table which will enable them to raise sufficient funding to take their technology to market and then grow at sufficient speed to win. That means sensible ownership structures - for investors, incubators, and universities - and a clear, focused roadmap, toward milestones (proof points, either technical or commercial) that the market (investors) will respond to. ‍ Planet-scale potential. Winning startups can deliver positive change across whole societies and national economies. To affect this change, above all else any “deeptech” should be fundamentally disruptive. When a tech startup goes to market, it can be a category creator or it can rapidly consolidate an existing fragmented industry. Step-change technology companies should have the ambition to go big, or go home.‍ Risk. Rarely in our experience do deeptech startups fail because of the technology. They fail because of the human factor: co-founders fall out, the CEO can’t hire the very best team, they get the go to market wrong or believe product wins when it’s more often than not distribution which beats product. Often precisely because of its transformative potential, deeptech involves risk and uncertainty. Sometimes these risks are regulatory, sometimes related to market adoption or timing. On the other hand, technology and intellectual property is often complex, making them harder for competitors to replicate.‍ High stakes. The problems humanity faces are significant. With climate change it could be existential, even if not in our lifetimes, for our children. Globally volatility across economies and interstate rivalry continues to increase. We are seeking companies which will contribute to solutions for these issues. We look at dual-use (those that may have a defense and civilian applications) and defense technologies, critical to national interest. Put simply, these startups matter. As capital allocators, we’ve never been more confident that, more than at any other time in history, it is deeptech which will be the foundation of our future health and prosperity. The world’s future trillion dollar companies are being created today. We embrace the uncertainties, because that is how we will find the teams who will deliver true progress. 7percent has flourished because so often, deeptech is overlooked and undercapitalized at the early stage. Building a great company is incredibly difficult. As a team of ex-founders, we have direct operational, technical and investment experience. We’ve been through the ups and downs since the first dot com bust. The stakes are too high for free society, to underinvest in these new technologies. We’ve committed our careers to this cause - to back the step change technology of the future. Founders make great sacrifices in their relentless pursuit to deliver solutions that matter to humanity and to bend the future in a more positive direction, to make a dent in the universe. We back the products and services that in ten years people will wonder “how the world ever lived without ''. Positive progress through technology and resilience — that's the 7percent mission. Welcome aboard our ship, on a journey of discovery. Content from contact.md Title: 7percent Ventures - Contact URL Source: https://www.7pc.vc/contact Markdown Content: 01 The venture capital industry is a power law game. Most of our fund’s returns will come from a small fraction of our portfolio – perhaps just one or two startups. Typically 4% of deployed capital provides \\>60% of returns. Each company we back must therefore have the potential to deliver us a 100x return, or more, in order for us to invest. It must have the potential to be a “fund returner”. 02 If you do the maths how investing in a company plays out, with a 1m investment from a 100m fund into a startup with a valuation of 10m, if sold for 1bn, will probably give the investor a ~50x return (depending on dilution) which is only 50m. That’s not even enough to pay back the fund. This is why investors have to model every investment and be convinced that very large outcomes are possible and the valuations investors are willing to invest at, usually reflect the calculation they make. 03 7percent Ventures was founded to seek out the most ambitious founding teams who want to transform markets and ultimately change the way the world works, for the better. We’re mostly venture, part capital.As you can read here that 7percent is ex-founder led. We’ve been where the founders who pitch us have: starting a company, raising money, failed, succeeded, done the hard graft. As founders we’ve knocked on hundreds of doors to get investment and as fund managers we’ve done the same to raise our VC fund. 04 At 7percent, we are on the same side of the table as the founders we back. We have a no-nonsense communication style, opting for openness over optionality and do our best to empathise with the founder’s perspective. We’ll tell you bluntly what we think and why we will or won’t invest, because that is what we wanted as founders. We also add value via a highly curated adviser network Text: 7EVN, URL: http://7pc.co/ and our team’s own entrepreneurial experience to lean on. We at least attempt to reply to every inbound, though as a small four person team with over 2,500 inbound decks every year, we’ve sometimes been slower than we would like. Finally, we’re not afraid to take big leaps into the future. In fact, that is what we care about. A stepchange in capability or a fundamental shift in the way a market works. If you can’t explain why you’re 10x better in some way and can win, we’re the wrong VC. 05 The number seven is a Text: lucky number, URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luckynumber#Luckyprime in a number of cultures. Rate of growth differentiates startups from other types of business and the 7% number represents a Text: week on week growth rate, URL: http://paulgraham.com/ which usually means your startup is doing something right. The growth KPI, your ‘north star metric’ should be one of revenue or a proxy for revenue, some other metric which will define future value in the business; e.g. user base. Each company is different. You’ll need to be doing 7% WoW (or around 30% MoM) growth of your north star metric consistenly for 6+ months, to raise a great Series-A. This is almost universally the case, but there are always exceptions of course. Deeptech companies don’t have a growth rate like that early on, because they are usually pre-product and sometimes still building the technology even at Series-A. That’s fine. But once you launch a product into market, we’d want to see that aggressive growth. We believe rate of growth defines a startup over a more traditional business. Paul Graham, Founder of Y-Combinator wrote at length about Text: startup growth here, URL: http://paulgraham.com/ which echoes our thinking as well as anyone. It is also said there are seven fundamental types of Text: catastrophe, URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophetheory – and we’d like to help you avoid catastrophes. 06 Yes. $250k-$2m tickets (as well as angel cheques), as early stage as possible. 07 Driving the business toward a key “north-star metric” enables an early stage startup to avoid distraction and clearly track the impact of iteration, product optimization and success or failure of product/market fit. Too often we hear founders say “we’re focused on” and then list three or even five things. That’s not focus. Failure to focus means distraction by lots of things which will keep you and your team busy, they might even be genuinely important, but with limited cash runway (and thus limited time) every hour counts towards demonstrating, through an aggressive growth rate with a curve up and to the right, that you’re solving a painful problem for a someone in a great way and have found a scalable way to go to market, even if initially in a specific vertical, segment or territory, of your Text: SOM, URL: https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=tam+sam+som&oq=tam+sam+som&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60j69i65j69i60l2.1059j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8. As with all rules there are exceptions. For deep-tech startups or startups who are pre-product, week on week growth may not be an appropriate measure, but the need focus and urgency remains, to drive the business to the next key inflection point of technical development, which will enable you to go back to market and raise your next round, to accelerate faster still. 08 The most appropriate north-star metric may change over time and can be different for each business. For example, a marketplace startup might begin by focusing on inventory growth, before switching to transactions (thus customer growth) before moving on to GMV (growth and retention). Other types of startup may from day one be able to use week on week or month on month revenue growth, which is ideal. Other metrics are still important (in our marketplace example they could include liquidity or LTV:CAC) but early on we believe you need to work out what the singular headline target is – and which other metrics feed into moving the dial with that number. Business decisions should cascade down from that north star metric and your weekly, monthly and quarterly goals should drive that north star metric up. A north star metric is a way to choose what NOT to do, as much as what to do. 09 Early stage companies should aim for between 5 and 10% week on week growth of your north star metric; ideally revenue but if not revenue it could be user signups for example (if user signups represent the future value in the business from which revenue will be generated). 5 to 10% week on week is not sustainable forever but should be achievable early on (e.g. your first couple of million in revenue or your first million users). Paul Graham, Founder of Y-Combinator, wrote an excellent Text: blog on startup growth, URL: http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html we recommend you read. 10 Why partner with us attempts to answer this question. Any other benefits of working with 7percent? An invitation to Text: The ICE List, URL: http://icelist.eu/ tech Founders group: Co-Founded by 7percent Founding Partner Andrew J Scott in 2009, this is ICE is a not-for-profit tight-knit group of Founders, Investors and key ecosystem players who travel, do away weekends, dinners and off-sites to share knowledge, war stories and build friendships.Access to the other Founders in our portfolio. We have an email group where you can reach the other 200 portfolio founders and aluni. In 2024 we also hope to bring everyone together into one place for a weekend of shared experiences, discussions, learning and fun. Introductions to follow on investment via 7EVN and our wider network. Our goal as a Seed investor is to make sure we agree a strategy to get you to your next funding round. The team has experience in the U.S. aswell as the U.K. This can be critical when you want to expand to the U.S. or have to raise money outside of the U.K. or Europe. 11 Most decent investment funds have a network of friends, colleagues, trusted suppliers and alumni to call on. At 7percent we have gone a step further and brought together seasoned entrepreneurs, specialist and corporate operators who can add value or specific knowledge at the right time in the right way for your startup, via our platform: Text: 7EVN, URL: http://www.7evn.co/, and we pay them by sharing some of our own carry (our investment returns). 7EVN Advisors are ex-founders, colleagues and friends who are experts in their field, many from the top startups in the world (Meta, AirBnB, Oculus, etc).You can use this network for introductions, explore joint ventures, gain introductions to customers or even eventual M&A, as well as tangible help when you need it providing advice for specific areas of your business adhoc e.g. data science, SEO, product virality, sales, etcetera. All these advisors are themselves investors in our fund and incentized by us because we share our own General Partner carry (fund profits) with them. You can pick up the phone or send an email for advice without worrying if they’re going to expect share options or payment. Simple. 12 We believe in using standard plain English terms, which represent market norms, with nothing onerous. Typical terms: You can expect to give away 10-30% at each round of investment, depending on how “hot” you are. Early stage rounds are a function of round size. And how much you can raise is a reflection of what the market thinks you can sensibly spend to get to your next major inflection point. How “hot” you are is driven by numerous factors but it manifests as how many termsheets you have – i.e. how many people are competing to invest. MFN clause - a most favoured nation clause means that if you do a down round or give away better terms after we have invested but before any SAFE or ASA converts, we are able to switch to those better terms. This provides some down round protection. Co-founder vesting – if not already in place. An effective board, or agreement to put one in place – one or two people with appropriate experience at early stage is plenty, any more are a distraction. Regular monthly board meetings – although 7percent do not take board seats and while it might sound bureaucratic, there are very obvious reasons why a monthly check-in with a supportive board is great for your startup and you as a founder(s) to pause and consider whether you’re focused on the right things and delivering to targets. A month is a long time in startup land. Agree weekly or monthly projections for your north star metric – and a check in call once a quarter in the first 12 months, to see how you’re doing and how we can help. We recommend that all founders send all investors a brief monthly email update. 14 Closing fees. Board seat fees (and we rarely take board seats and when we have we have not charged fees). Fees paid as cash back or a levy on the money we have invested. Expensive legal fees (we won’t charge any legal fees if the template docs are used, if we negotiate and have to engage counsel then we’ll pass on our fees at cost). Pre-emption rights – preventing you from raising from someone else.Equity control of your business – we take a minority stake. Board control – we don’t take board seats. 14 We don’t usually invest outside of UK, Europe or the United States. Founder(s) must still be working full time in the business and have control of the business. Any university, inventor, or silent owner must have a small, minority stake. This will vary, but should usually be 10% or less, unless the person invested real cash. Univerisity spin outs should have no onerous terms in perpetuity hanging over the business or revenue line. If working in partnership with a research group at the University, the startup should have first right of refusal at a pre-agree cost, to take any future IP related to the core IP into the business on an exclusive basis. IP should be fully owned by the business or in the process of being transferred into the business in full. The usual good standing of the founders and the business, with no pending legal disputes or red flags with KYC or AML. 15 The money invested up until 2018 was private money generated by the entrepreneurs who are partners in the fund. Since 2018 we have some of the best LP (Limited Partner) investors in the industry, from institutional investors like Atomic, British Business Bank and Molten Ventures, to HNWs and experienced founders such as Text: Taavet Hinkrus (WISE), URL: https://www.linkedin.com/in/taavethinrikus/ and Text: Karel Obluk (AVG)., URL: https://www.linkedin.com/in/karelobluk/# 16 All team members (not just Partners) contribute to our weekly IC meetings and any team member can champion a startup. Our IC is not run by consensus. We believe this helps us avoid the perils of groupthink. 17 We keep operational costs low and do not operate as a traditional VC having large fancy offices. In this respect we operate more like angels investors. 7percent team success is aligned with our own investors success. For example, our fee load across the 10 year lifecycle of Fund 2 is just 15% and we recycle those fees (meaning we recycle profit into new investments). 18 In venture capital Limited Partners (investors into a fund) are paid back before the people who run the fund, get to share in any upside. As is typical for a VC fund, the waterfall looks like this: 1\\. Limited Partners (investors in the fund) receive all their money back 2\\. Recycle fees (profits are invested into startups up to the fee load, if within the investment period) 3\\. Further profits (shared between investors and 7percent with 20% going to the team and our 7EVN advisor network and the rest to LPs) 19 Yes, if your startup is performing we sometimes invest via an SPV (special purpose vehicle) to take up our pro-rata. But we don’t lead future rounds. We believe you should take stage-appropriate funding, meaning take Pre/Seed money from a Pre/Seed fund, not a Series-A fund, because if then that fund does not lead your Series-A round, other investors will wonder why, making it harder for you to raise.In 2024 we expect to have an opportunity fund to take up our pro-rata in our portfolio. 20 If you have a round led by a new VC we’ll follow-on. In other scenarios, where there is no clear next round lead investor (for example a bridge round) we’ll always be transparent with you about whether we think your startup growth is tracking appropriately. We’ll also try and help you solve problems and remove blockers to your success, along the way, if it is not. We recognise that an investor simply saying you need more traction as feedback on the likelihood of investment (or a follow-on investment) is unhelpful. Whenever possible we’ll give you specific metrics that mean we’ll be able to re-invest and articulate to you what we believe success looks like and what we believe the rest of the investor market will respond positively to. The follow-on rate can be a contentious issue for both funds and startups. The hard truth is that if your startup is making decent progress we’ll reinvest. If your startup is tanking/failing, we probably won’t – but then neither is anyone else likely to. We believe you should only try and raise money when you can and we’ll very happily help you formulate a strategy to make that possible. Throughout, we will be honest with you every step of the way about how we feel you’re doing and help you however we can to resolve any problems along the way. We’ve been founders ourselves and all raised money, so we know what it feels like to be in your shoes. 21 Yes. We’ve led or co-led around 15% since 2020. 22 Please make sure you Text: understand the size, stage and type of investments we do., URL: https://www.7pc.vc/how-we-invest If your vision does not involve changing the world for the better, we’re not the firm for you. Your deck must include: 1\\. A vision which describes the impact you want to have on the world and what problem you solve. 2\\. How you solve this problem and why your solution is 10x better. 3\\. Reasons why you and your team have an unfair advantage over others, to deliver on this vision. 4\\. If you’re in-market include your current Text: week on week growth rate, URL: http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html (or equivalents) for your north star metric. If not, your progress to-date developing your technology. 5\\. A breakdown of the market size and your initial bridgehead target market size and description. 6\\. A narrative about how you go from where you are today, to world domination: your go to market strategy. 7\\. An articulation why your startup will be a multi-$bn company and why others who do this or something similar, will lose. It’s not mandatory but if possible get a personal introduction to one of our partners; this is a people business and a good recommendation from someone we respect, goes a long way.We try to reply to every enquiry, provided it fits our stage and thesis. If you send us a Series-A pitch for yet another marketplace, app or SaaS product of which there are hundreds doing the same thing already, don’t expect a reply. 23 Please note that due to of our operational structure and to minimize operational overheads we do not have available capital to sponsor events. We are happy to speak at or support events in any other way we can. Content from how-we-invest.md Title: 7percent Ventures - Thesis URL Source: https://www.7pc.vc/how-we-invest Markdown Content: How we invest. We care about fundamental disruption, not iterative improvements. Our thesis Change is the prerequisite to disruption. Therefore, to monopolize a market globally we believe you must fundamentally disrupt it. To do that you must have a product which solves a painful problem in a notional 10x better way than existing solutions. Or, serves a need which today is not being satisfied in another way. We don’t just look for Unicorns, but Decacorns. We seek multi-billion dollar opportunity, which we define as: A startup which is doing something which in the future will be scalable enough in a large enough market for a future valuation of multiple $bn’s to not just be feasible, but probable, assuming the startup executes well. The Founder(s) have a narrative which explains why they believe (1) is true. A CEO who has the ambition and drive to want to build such a business and can evidence from their actions and choices thus far that this is the case, even if the company is very early, or even still on the drawing board. Many Founders claim they want to build a $bn business, but only some articulate their playbook as to how. You need to understand the inflection points your business needs to hit, and the money you think it might need to raise, to deliver on your vision. We know this playbook will change and evolve but together we can then get behind an aggressive plan, to deliver the change in the world you want to see. Our approach Deeptech -------- We care about fundamental disruption, not iterative improvements. A known technical solution applied to fundamentally change how a vast laggard market works: removing someone from the value chain, making the product or service 10 or 100x cheaper, better, or all of the above. “Transformative” startups in our portfolio include: Flexport, Archax, Earnr and BreezeAI. Deeptech where one of the core challenges is primarily technical, but if you solve that technical problem by building a commercial solution, it can take command of a huge market which is often nascent. This could be in anything from next generation quantum computing to the new space economy. “Frontier technology” startups in our portfolio include: OculusVR, Gensyn, Univeral Quantum, PlumerAI, Beyond Aero and Mind Portal.

If you’re a Series-B company from Timbuctoo and enquire we probably won’t respond as you’ve clearly not read our thesis. We also do not recommend using fundraising platforms that mass market your company to lots of investors. It often appears as spam, which can do more damage than good.

We founded tech-companies worth more than €2B, including Dailydeal and Forto As VCs at Earlybird and Speedinvest, we invested more than €400M, with top-quartile returns. We co-founded Leaders For Climate Action and are ambassadors of Founder’s Pledge.

Venture Capital has not evolved since the 1960s. VCs are still seeking to maximize financial returns while disregarding adverse effects on society and environment. SOLUTION It’s time for a system upgrade: Impact Venture Capitalism --------------------------------------------------------- AENU drives systemic transformation in venture capital towards impact, accessibility and stakeholder-alignment. We are an impact technology fund aligned with Article 9 SFDR. Our focus is on early stage climate tech companies based in Europe. Impact capitalism is a transformed capitalist system that optimizes for environmental and social wellbeing. Impact ESG Our Impact Framework Our state-of-the-art integrated impact framework helps us identify the type of global challenges we are striving to solve, the depth and breadth of the impact we are after, and the necessary alignment to ensure a long-term, sustainable journey with our portfolio companies. Text: See our Impact Framework, URL: https://www.aenu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2.2.1-AENU-Impact-Framework.pdf The ESG Journey ESG is not a one solution-fits-all. The product, stakeholders, geography and size of the company determine the materiality of sustainability focus areas. Yet, minimum safeguards have to be met to become compliant, especially as regulation continues evolving. At AENU, we partner with and accompany our portfolio companies in their evolving ESG journey.

We define real opportunities as an approach to human wellbeing that aims to level the playing field by focusing on three principles: diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). “The route to achieving equity will not be accomplished through treating everyone equally.

That’s why we help early-stage founders with their pitch decks to create the maximum chance of success with their raise. Attract investors Why do most pitch decks fail to attract investor interest? Simply because key messaging is not communicated. Most founders know their business inside out, but very few understand: The small window a deck has to impress The key information investors are looking for and the level of detail (most give too much) The necessity of a professionally designed pitch. A pitch is the first impression of the business and first impressions count. How we can help Fixed price packages for investment ready pitch decks Our goal is to help founders present their businesses in the best possible light to potential investors.

EIS is designed to help smaller companies raise finance by offering a range of tax reliefs to investors who purchase new shares in qualifying companies. What tax reliefs are available? ------------------------------- Depending on individual circumstances, investors can enjoy some or all of the tax benefits noted below. Your Title Goes Here Your content goes here. Edit or remove this text inline or in the module Content settings. You can also style every aspect of this content in the module Design settings and even apply custom CSS to this text in the module Advanced settings. Income tax relief at 30% You will receive 30% tax relief on the amount invested in EIS qualifying companies against your income tax bill for the year of investment, up to a maximum of £2 million invested (provided that any amount above £1m is invested in Knowledge Intensive Companies). In addition, if you want to treat some or all of the shares subscribed for in the current tax year as though they were subscribed for in the previous tax year, then you may do so up to a further £1 million (reduced by any EIS investments already made in that tax year). Please note, with regard to our Committed Capital EIS Portfolio Service, not all your investments will necessarily fall in the same tax year unless you instruct us to do so. Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Deferral CGT, such as from the sale of shares or a second property, can be deferred for the life of the EIS investment. You can defer any gains made in the three years prior to, or the year following, the date your subscription is invested into EIS companies. There is no limit to the amount of gains that can be deferred for CGT purposes. 100% Inheritance Tax Exemption The companies in which we invest also qualify for Business Property Relief. This means that investments made through the Committed Capital EIS Portfolio Service can be exempt from inheritance tax (IHT) after just two years (from the point at which the investment into the underlying EIS company is made). In order to qualify, the investments must also be held at the time of death. Tax Free Growth All capital gains made from EIS investments are tax free (when held for the minimum 3 year holding period). Given the higher returns targeted by the Committed Capital EIS Portfolio Service, this is an important tax benefit, allowing investors to include smaller companies in their investment portfolio in a highly tax efficient manner. Loss Relief At the current rates of income tax, up to 45% loss relief may be available on any holdings that are realised at a loss net of initial income tax relief, helping to offset the effect of any assets which underperform in the overall portfolio. For a 45% taxpayer this would provide total tax relief of 61.5%. The investor can choose whether to set the loss relief against other gains made now or in the future, or against income for the year in which the loss arises or the previous year. The above tax advantages can only be claimed when the investors funds have been deployed into a company, rather than when an investor makes an initial subscription. The above does not constitute tax advice. It is recommended that investors take independent, tax, legal and financial advice from a qualified professional adviser before considering an investment. EIS Association --------------- We are members of the EIS Association (EISA) which is the official trade body for the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) and Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS) industry. EISA is a highly effective not-for-profit organisation that exists to aid the provision of capital to UK small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through these two schemes. EISA works closely with HM Treasury, HM Revenue and Customs, government ministers, MPs and the FCA to enhance EISs and SEISs and promote the benefits of using them to investors, companies and their respective advisers. EISA collaborates with other trade bodies that support investment into SMEs, including the British Venture Capital Association (BVCA), the Association of Investment Companies (AIC), the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) and the UK Business Angels Association (UKBAA). The EISA Director General sits on the BVCA Venture Capital Working Group, which aims to present a unified voice from all sections of the SME and venture finance industries to the UK government and the EU. EISA’s membership is drawn from all areas of the EIS/SEIS industry and includes EIS/SEIS fund managers, lawyers, accountants, tax advisers, corporate financiers, IFAs and wealth managers throughout the UK. Please contact Mary Rodgers at mary.rodgers@eisa.org.uk if you are interested in learning more about EISA and becoming a member.

Change of purpose We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so. Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law. 6\\. Sharing your personal data We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in paragraph 5 above. Note that this parties may change from time to time and we as the CCG are not obligated to inform you of these internal changes unless we deem it necessary. Third party suppliers such as such as Mainspring Fund Services Limited, Exact Financial Systems Limited, TipTop IT Ltd based inside the EU. W2 Global Data (Text: w2globaldata.com, URL: http://www.w2globaldata.com/) and third party money-laundering screening, credit reference and fraud prevention agencies based inside and outside the EU, for the purpose of carrying out Know Your Client checks in the context of a commercial acquisition or investment. Government bodies such as HMRC and the FCA based inside the UK where we are legally required to do so or upon their reasonable request. Our lawyers and FCA-approved co-investors. The funds which we manage from time to time based inside the EU. Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy. We require any third parties which we have contracted with to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions. 7\\. International Transfers The personal information that we collect from you will be stored at a destination within the UK or European Economic Area (“EEA”) and generally our processing of your personal data will not involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. In the event that our processing of your personal data does involve a transfer outside of the EEA, we will ensure an adequate degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: where we use certain service providers, we may use contracts which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; and where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield. This is especially important because some countries outside of the EEA may have a lower standard of protection for personal information, including lower security requirements and fewer rights for individuals. Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanisms that will be used by us if we transfer your personal data out of the EEA. 8\\. Security We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so. 9\\. Data Retention We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. We comply with best market practice and erase all user data held after a period of 6 years from the data not being legitimately in use, unless we are required to remove it for any reason before this date. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see “Right of erasure” below for further information. In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you. 10\\. Exercising your legal rights Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. You have the right to: Right of access: you can write to us to ask for confirmation of what personal information we hold about you and to request a copy of that information. Provided we are satisfied that you are entitled to see the personal information requested and we have successfully confirmed your identity, we will provide you with your personal information subject to any exemptions that apply. Right of erasure: at your request and where you are entitled to, we will delete your personal information from our records as far as we are required to do so. In many cases we will need to hold onto limited personal information about you in order to ensure we do not send you further communications. Right of rectification: if you believe our records of your personal information are inaccurate, you have the right to ask for those records to be updated. You can also ask us to check the personal information we hold about you if you are unsure whether it is accurate/up to date. Right to restrict processing: you have the right to ask for processing of your personal information to be restricted if there is disagreement about its accuracy or legitimate usage. Right to object: you have the right to object to processing where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation, which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information that override your rights and freedoms. Right to data portability: we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. Right to withdraw consent at any time, where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. No fee usually required You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. What we may need from you We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. Time limit to respond We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

W2 Global Data (Text: w2globaldata.com, URL: http://www.w2globaldata.com/) and third party money-laundering screening, credit reference and fraud prevention agencies based inside and outside the EU, for the purpose of carrying out Know Your Client checks in the context of a commercial acquisition or investment. Government bodies such as HMRC and the FCA based inside the UK where we are legally required to do so or upon their reasonable request. Our lawyers and FCA-approved co-investors. The funds which we manage from time to time based inside the EU. Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy. We require any third parties which we have contracted with to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions. 7\\. International Transfers The personal information that we collect from you will be stored at a destination within the UK or European Economic Area (“EEA”) and generally our processing of your personal data will not involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. In the event that our processing of your personal data does involve a transfer outside of the EEA, we will ensure an adequate degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: where we use certain service providers, we may use contracts which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; and where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield. This is especially important because some countries outside of the EEA may have a lower standard of protection for personal information, including lower security requirements and fewer rights for individuals. Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanisms that will be used by us if we transfer your personal data out of the EEA. 8\\. Security We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so. 9\\. Data Retention We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. We comply with best market practice and erase all user data held after a period of 6 years from the data not being legitimately in use, unless we are required to remove it for any reason before this date. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see “Right of erasure” below for further information. In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you. 10\\. Exercising your legal rights Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. You have the right to: Right of access: you can write to us to ask for confirmation of what personal information we hold about you and to request a copy of that information. Provided we are satisfied that you are entitled to see the personal information requested and we have successfully confirmed your identity, we will provide you with your personal information subject to any exemptions that apply. Right of erasure: at your request and where you are entitled to, we will delete your personal information from our records as far as we are required to do so. In many cases we will need to hold onto limited personal information about you in order to ensure we do not send you further communications. Right of rectification: if you believe our records of your personal information are inaccurate, you have the right to ask for those records to be updated. You can also ask us to check the personal information we hold about you if you are unsure whether it is accurate/up to date. Right to restrict processing: you have the right to ask for processing of your personal information to be restricted if there is disagreement about its accuracy or legitimate usage. Right to object: you have the right to object to processing where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation, which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information that override your rights and freedoms. Right to data portability: we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. Right to withdraw consent at any time, where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. No fee usually required You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. What we may need from you We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. Time limit to respond We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

This is a high-risk investment. You could lose all the money you invest. Take 2 min to learn more One investment strategy. ======================== Four investment routes. ======================= We are a growth stage venture capital investor, and our investment strategy has remained unchanged since 2001. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We invest in best in class high growth, post revenue technology companies (over £1m) across a range of industry sectors in which we believe the potential for significant capital growth exists, and in which we can provide hands-on support to help facilitate growth through to a successful exit. Growth EIS Fund --------------- The Committed Capital Growth EIS Portfolio Service is an evergreen fund offering investors the opportunity to invest into a portfolio of 8-12 actively managed, growth stage, post-revenue (over £1m) technology companies, whilst also benefitting from the availability of the generous tax reliefs afforded by the Enterprise Investment Scheme. Investment Objectives We are a growth stage venture capital investor, and our investment strategy has remained unchanged since 2001. We invest in best in class high growth, EIS qualifying post revenue technology companies (over £1m) in a range of industry sectors where we believe the potential for significant capital growth exists, and where we can offer hands-on support to facilitate and accelerate growth before ultimately helping identify potential exit opportunities. Our primary objective is to create attractive returns for investors from high quality investments, through the careful selection of potential investee companies, excellence in corporate finance skills and active support of portfolio companies. Text: Read More…, URL: https://committedcapital.co.uk/growth-eis-fund/ Knowledge-Intensive EIS Fund ---------------------------- The Committed Capital Knowledge-Intensive EIS Fund replicates the investment strategy of our Committed Capital EIS Funds, investing in high growth, knowledge intensive, EIS qualifying, post revenue technology companies (typically over £1m), across a range of industry sectors where we believe the potential for significant capital growth exists, and where we can offer strategic hands-on support to facilitate and accelerate growth before ultimately helping identify potential exit opportunities. Why is this of potential interest to investors and advisers? Tax planning and administrative advantages. A Knowledge-Intensive (KI) Approved Fund Structure tackles two administrative issues for EIS investors, uncertain allotment dates for tax planning and the administrative burden of claiming tax relief with multiple EIS3 certificates. With a KI fund, on the admin side, instead of receiving an EIS3 certificate for each investee company, the fund manager retains all EIS3 forms and issues just 1 EIS5 certificate. With KI approved funds, tax relief applies at the date the fund closes, so for example if the fund closes on 5 April 2025, then an investor has certainty that they will receive full tax relief on their net subscription in 2024-25 even though the money has not yet been invested. They can also treat the investment as carried back to the previous year. Quick Deployment – Unlike other KI Funds, the Committed Capital Knowledge-Intensive EIS Funds target full deployment within just 3 months of the fund close date, significantly reducing the time frame in which investors receive their EIS5 certificate to claim tax relief. The HMRC Approved Committed Capital Knowledge-Intensive EIS Portfolio Service III closes on 4th April 2025 with targeted full deployment by 30th June 2025.

Investment Objectives The objective of Fastrack is to pursue its proven strategy of active investment in high growth UK technology companies in order to create superior financial returns for investors.

Text: I acknowledge this risk statement and accept the terms and conditions., URL: https://committedcapital.co.uk/investment-opportunities/# [×](javascript:;) What are the key risks? --------------------------- 1\\. You could lose all the money you invest If the business you invest in fails, you are likely to lose 100% of the money you invested. Most start-up businesses fail. 2\\. You will not be protected for poor investment performance Protection from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), in relation to claims against failed regulated firms, does not cover poor investment performance. You may only be eligible to claim compensation from the FSCS in certain circumstances if we, any approved bank, our nominee company, or eligible custodian are in default. Most types of investment business are covered in full for the first £85,000 of any eligible claim. Try the FSCS investment protection checker Text: here, URL: https://www.fscs.org.uk/check/investment-protection-checker/. \\[https://www.fscs.org.uk/check/investment-protection-checker\\] Protection from the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) does not cover poor investment performance. If you have a complaint against an FCA-regulated firm, FOS may be able to consider it. Learn more about FOS protection Text: here, URL: https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumers. \\[https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumers\\] 3\\. You won’t get your money back quickly Even if the business you invest in is successful, it may take several years to get your money back. You are unlikely to be able to sell your investment early. The most likely way to get your money back is if the business is bought by another business or lists its shares on an exchange such as the London Stock Exchange. These events are not common. If you are investing in a start-up business, you should not expect to get your money back through dividends. Start-up businesses rarely pay these. 4\\. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket Putting all your money into a single business or type of investment for example, is risky. Spreading your money across different investments makes you less dependent on any one to do well. A good rule of thumb is not to invest more than 10% of your money in Text: high-risk investments, URL: https://www.fca.org.uk/investsmart/5-questions-ask-you-invest. \\[https://www.fca.org.uk/investsmart/5-questions-ask-you-invest\\] 5\\. The value of your investment can be reduced The percentage of the business that you own will decrease if the business issues more shares. This could mean that the value of your investment reduces, depending on how much the business grows. Most start-up businesses issue multiple rounds of shares. These new shares could have additional rights that your shares don’t have, such as the right to receive a fixed dividend, which could further reduce your chances of getting a return on your investment.

We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests.

You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us. 3\\.

We may also use your personal data to comply with LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, for example to co-operate with regulatory, government and/or law enforcement bodies with whom we may work (for example requirements relating to the payment of tax or anti-money laundering). As a FCA regulated firm, we are required to conduct due diligence on investors in our funds, organisations in which our funds invest, directors and senior management or trustees of those organisations, individuals and organisations we invest alongside and purchasers when we exit an investment, for the purposes of preventing financial crime. In order to fulfil our obligations, we are required to verify the organisation’s identity and conduct certain background screening. This may include verifying the identity of the organisation's shareholders, beneficial owners, management, directors, trustees or officers and/or other relevant information. To assist us with the verification and screening process, contact details you provide will be disclosed to anti-money laundering screening, credit reference and fraud prevention agencies which may keep a record of that information. If we need to conduct this due diligence using any of the personal information you have provided us with, you will be provided with further information prior to us doing so. We may also share this information with our lawyers and FCA-approved co-investors in relation to the particular transaction as is customary in the sector to avoid you having to provide the information more than once. Marketing We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. Promotional offers from us We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing). You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased work, services, activities or products from us or if you provided us with your details when you registered for a promotion and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing. Third-party marketing We will not share your personal data with any company outside Committed Capital for marketing purposes. Opting out You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by contacting us at any time. Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a service purchase, service experience or other transactions. Cookies You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly. Please see our Cookie Policy for further details. Change of purpose We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so. Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law. 6\\. Sharing your personal data We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in paragraph 5 above. Note that this parties may change from time to time and we as the CCG are not obligated to inform you of these internal changes unless we deem it necessary. Third party suppliers such as such as Mainspring Fund Services Limited, Exact Financial Systems Limited, TipTop IT Ltd based inside the EU. W2 Global Data (Text: w2globaldata.com, URL: http://www.w2globaldata.com/) and third party money-laundering screening, credit reference and fraud prevention agencies based inside and outside the EU, for the purpose of carrying out Know Your Client checks in the context of a commercial acquisition or investment. Government bodies such as HMRC and the FCA based inside the UK where we are legally required to do so or upon their reasonable request. Our lawyers and FCA-approved co-investors. The funds which we manage from time to time based inside the EU. Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy. We require any third parties which we have contracted with to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions. 7\\. International Transfers The personal information that we collect from you will be stored at a destination within the UK or European Economic Area (“EEA”) and generally our processing of your personal data will not involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. In the event that our processing of your personal data does involve a transfer outside of the EEA, we will ensure an adequate degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: where we use certain service providers, we may use contracts which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; and where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield. This is especially important because some countries outside of the EEA may have a lower standard of protection for personal information, including lower security requirements and fewer rights for individuals. Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanisms that will be used by us if we transfer your personal data out of the EEA. 8\\. Security We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so. 9\\. Data Retention We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. We comply with best market practice and erase all user data held after a period of 6 years from the data not being legitimately in use, unless we are required to remove it for any reason before this date. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see “Right of erasure” below for further information. In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you. 10\\. Exercising your legal rights Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. You have the right to: Right of access: you can write to us to ask for confirmation of what personal information we hold about you and to request a copy of that information. Provided we are satisfied that you are entitled to see the personal information requested and we have successfully confirmed your identity, we will provide you with your personal information subject to any exemptions that apply. Right of erasure: at your request and where you are entitled to, we will delete your personal information from our records as far as we are required to do so. In many cases we will need to hold onto limited personal information about you in order to ensure we do not send you further communications. Right of rectification: if you believe our records of your personal information are inaccurate, you have the right to ask for those records to be updated. You can also ask us to check the personal information we hold about you if you are unsure whether it is accurate/up to date. Right to restrict processing: you have the right to ask for processing of your personal information to be restricted if there is disagreement about its accuracy or legitimate usage. Right to object: you have the right to object to processing where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation, which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information that override your rights and freedoms. Right to data portability: we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. Right to withdraw consent at any time, where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. No fee usually required You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. What we may need from you We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. Time limit to respond We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests.

We may also use your personal data to comply with LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, for example to co-operate with regulatory, government and/or law enforcement bodies with whom we may work (for example requirements relating to the payment of tax or anti-money laundering). As a FCA regulated firm, we are required to conduct due diligence on investors in our funds, organisations in which our funds invest, directors and senior management or trustees of those organisations, individuals and organisations we invest alongside and purchasers when we exit an investment, for the purposes of preventing financial crime. In order to fulfil our obligations, we are required to verify the organisation’s identity and conduct certain background screening. This may include verifying the identity of the organisation's shareholders, beneficial owners, management, directors, trustees or officers and/or other relevant information. To assist us with the verification and screening process, contact details you provide will be disclosed to anti-money laundering screening, credit reference and fraud prevention agencies which may keep a record of that information. If we need to conduct this due diligence using any of the personal information you have provided us with, you will be provided with further information prior to us doing so. We may also share this information with our lawyers and FCA-approved co-investors in relation to the particular transaction as is customary in the sector to avoid you having to provide the information more than once. Marketing We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. Promotional offers from us We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing). You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased work, services, activities or products from us or if you provided us with your details when you registered for a promotion and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing. Third-party marketing We will not share your personal data with any company outside Committed Capital for marketing purposes. Opting out You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by contacting us at any time. Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a service purchase, service experience or other transactions. Cookies You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly. Please see our Cookie Policy for further details. Change of purpose We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so. Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law. 6\\. Sharing your personal data We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in paragraph 5 above. Note that this parties may change from time to time and we as the CCG are not obligated to inform you of these internal changes unless we deem it necessary. Third party suppliers such as such as Mainspring Fund Services Limited, Exact Financial Systems Limited, TipTop IT Ltd based inside the EU. W2 Global Data (Text: w2globaldata.com, URL: http://www.w2globaldata.com/) and third party money-laundering screening, credit reference and fraud prevention agencies based inside and outside the EU, for the purpose of carrying out Know Your Client checks in the context of a commercial acquisition or investment. Government bodies such as HMRC and the FCA based inside the UK where we are legally required to do so or upon their reasonable request. Our lawyers and FCA-approved co-investors. The funds which we manage from time to time based inside the EU. Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy. We require any third parties which we have contracted with to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions. 7\\. International Transfers The personal information that we collect from you will be stored at a destination within the UK or European Economic Area (“EEA”) and generally our processing of your personal data will not involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. In the event that our processing of your personal data does involve a transfer outside of the EEA, we will ensure an adequate degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: where we use certain service providers, we may use contracts which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; and where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield. This is especially important because some countries outside of the EEA may have a lower standard of protection for personal information, including lower security requirements and fewer rights for individuals. Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanisms that will be used by us if we transfer your personal data out of the EEA. 8\\. Security We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so. 9\\. Data Retention We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. We comply with best market practice and erase all user data held after a period of 6 years from the data not being legitimately in use, unless we are required to remove it for any reason before this date. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see “Right of erasure” below for further information. In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you. 10\\. Exercising your legal rights Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. You have the right to: Right of access: you can write to us to ask for confirmation of what personal information we hold about you and to request a copy of that information. Provided we are satisfied that you are entitled to see the personal information requested and we have successfully confirmed your identity, we will provide you with your personal information subject to any exemptions that apply. Right of erasure: at your request and where you are entitled to, we will delete your personal information from our records as far as we are required to do so. In many cases we will need to hold onto limited personal information about you in order to ensure we do not send you further communications. Right of rectification: if you believe our records of your personal information are inaccurate, you have the right to ask for those records to be updated. You can also ask us to check the personal information we hold about you if you are unsure whether it is accurate/up to date. Right to restrict processing: you have the right to ask for processing of your personal information to be restricted if there is disagreement about its accuracy or legitimate usage. Right to object: you have the right to object to processing where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation, which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information that override your rights and freedoms. Right to data portability: we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. Right to withdraw consent at any time, where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. No fee usually required You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. What we may need from you We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. Time limit to respond We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

Committed Capital is made up of a highly experienced team of private equity, corporate finance and management consulting professionals and senior operational managers, from leading investment firms, banks, consultancies and blue chip industrials, both in the UK and internationally.

We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests.

In order to fulfil our obligations, we are required to verify the organisation’s identity and conduct certain background screening.

To assist us with the verification and screening process, contact details you provide will be disclosed to anti-money laundering screening, credit reference and fraud prevention agencies which may keep a record of that information. If we need to conduct this due diligence using any of the personal information you have provided us with, you will be provided with further information prior to us doing so. We may also share this information with our lawyers and FCA-approved co-investors in relation to the particular transaction as is customary in the sector to avoid you having to provide the information more than once. Marketing We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. Promotional offers from us We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).

If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly. Please see our Cookie Policy for further details. Change of purpose We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so. Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law. 6\\. Sharing your personal data We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in paragraph 5 above. Note that this parties may change from time to time and we as the CCG are not obligated to inform you of these internal changes unless we deem it necessary. Third party suppliers such as such as Mainspring Fund Services Limited, Exact Financial Systems Limited, TipTop IT Ltd based inside the EU. W2 Global Data (Text: w2globaldata.com, URL: http://www.w2globaldata.com/) and third party money-laundering screening, credit reference and fraud prevention agencies based inside and outside the EU, for the purpose of carrying out Know Your Client checks in the context of a commercial acquisition or investment. Government bodies such as HMRC and the FCA based inside the UK where we are legally required to do so or upon their reasonable request. Our lawyers and FCA-approved co-investors. The funds which we manage from time to time based inside the EU. Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy. We require any third parties which we have contracted with to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions. 7\\. International Transfers The personal information that we collect from you will be stored at a destination within the UK or European Economic Area (“EEA”) and generally our processing of your personal data will not involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. In the event that our processing of your personal data does involve a transfer outside of the EEA, we will ensure an adequate degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: where we use certain service providers, we may use contracts which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; and where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield. This is especially important because some countries outside of the EEA may have a lower standard of protection for personal information, including lower security requirements and fewer rights for individuals. Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanisms that will be used by us if we transfer your personal data out of the EEA. 8\\. Security We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so. 9\\. Data Retention We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. We comply with best market practice and erase all user data held after a period of 6 years from the data not being legitimately in use, unless we are required to remove it for any reason before this date. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see “Right of erasure” below for further information. In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you. 10\\. Exercising your legal rights Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. You have the right to: Right of access: you can write to us to ask for confirmation of what personal information we hold about you and to request a copy of that information. Provided we are satisfied that you are entitled to see the personal information requested and we have successfully confirmed your identity, we will provide you with your personal information subject to any exemptions that apply. Right of erasure: at your request and where you are entitled to, we will delete your personal information from our records as far as we are required to do so. In many cases we will need to hold onto limited personal information about you in order to ensure we do not send you further communications. Right of rectification: if you believe our records of your personal information are inaccurate, you have the right to ask for those records to be updated. You can also ask us to check the personal information we hold about you if you are unsure whether it is accurate/up to date. Right to restrict processing: you have the right to ask for processing of your personal information to be restricted if there is disagreement about its accuracy or legitimate usage. Right to object: you have the right to object to processing where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation, which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information that override your rights and freedoms. Right to data portability: we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. Right to withdraw consent at any time, where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. No fee usually required You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. What we may need from you We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. Time limit to respond We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

We focus mainly on the quality of our partnership and if we are able to be helpful to you and your startup. Sometimes there are better partners for your business, and we aren’t afraid to tell you that. Text: How much do you invest?, URL: https://www.concrete.vc/faqs/#We typically invest between $250,000 – $500,000 on the first cheque. We reserve additional investment as your company progresses to Seed and sometimes Series A. This means our investment in your company has the potential to grow over time. Text: Do you lead rounds?, URL: https://www.concrete.vc/faqs/#Yes, we lead rounds. We’re fine to join syndicates and collectively invest, as well. Text: What value do you add?, URL: https://www.concrete.vc/faqs/#We know as a founder your time is valuable. We believe our job is to help support you in many domains. We do this in many different ways by helping you find your next hire, introducing you to your next investor, negotiating discounts and better rates at many service providers and so much more. We definitely suggest checking out our main page for more information and please pick up the phone and call any of our portfolio founders to see what value we provide. Investment Criteria ------------------- Text: What stage do you invest at, and what do you look for?, URL: https://www.concrete.vc/faqs/# We are pre-seed investors at our core. Here is what we look for: You have an initial team covering both the business and technical side of the company or a line of sight of achieving this post-investment (i.e. hires identified). You have either an MVP, prototype, or some form or product that is demoable. We are not afraid to invest at the idea stage, but the stars have to align. You have a 12-18 month plan that demonstrates the company’s ability to reach the next round of funding. Text: What exactly is pre-seed?, URL: https://www.concrete.vc/faqs/#Venture capital has evolved over the years and continues to evolve. In our view, pre-seed is anywhere from a pitch deck to an MVP with less than $100k in revenue. We are mainly investing in the founding team and their conviction about the market opportunity they are chasing. Text: Do you invest in Seed+ stage companies?, URL: https://www.concrete.vc/faqs/#We really try to stay in our lane and invest in pre-seed companies, however, we have made some investments in what we’d describe as early seed companies. We do not invest in companies that are Series A+. Our Process ----------- Kick-off meeting An opportunity to get to know each other, for you to introduce your business, and for us to introduce Concrete Ventures. Qualifying An internal stage where we determine if we are the right partner for your business. Second Meeting Usually 1-1.5 hours in length, this is the time for us to go deep on any areas of interest. And for you to ask us the tough questions as well. Researching An internal stage where we extensively research & validate the many aspects of the investment opportunity. Decision The final stage where a decision is made and communicated back to you.

Our mission is to spot the brightest enabling technologies and help in turning them into global winners. We believe in building businesses that grow and succeed as leaders in their categories. We value niche solutions for a specific global market over more general offerings with limited geographical reach. Our approach is best suited for ambitious entrepreneurs with a global mindset: As opposed to building references in neighborhoods close by, we will push you to go directly to the ideal customers, wherever in the world they are. Investment Philosophy At Conor, innovative technology is the heart of everything. We look for early stage businesses with protectable core technology and global ambition. Our investments are typically within ICT, electronics, embedded systems, and new materials & optics. If your company fulfills the below criteria, we are interested: – Large international market opportunity – Compelling value proposition and scalable business model – Stellar and hungry core team – Disruptive technology and sustainable competitive advantage – Ability of Conor team to add value to business design and execution In contrast, we are likely not interested in ventures with lower ambition levels, limited scalability and regional or local target markets.

A strong entrepreneurial team is crucial to the success of a startup. Meet our Team Our team has collectively long, relevant, and unique experience in investing in both listed and unlisted companies in technology, health, and sustainability. Value-creating investments A key factor is to develop a sustainable product and business model that is closely linked to customers. It is the customers who ultimately assess the benefits and value of the product. An entrepreneurial team that has developed and launched the product often needs to be developed and supplemented with new members during the commercialization phase. The same goes for the board. Business development becomes a priority for both the board and management, with clear objectives, strategies and business models needed both internally in the company and for external communication. Aiming for future innovation ---------------------------- The investor team at First Venture, led by First Venture founders Rune Nordlander and Peter Werme, collectively have long, relevant, and unique experience in investing in both listed and unlisted companies in technology, health, and sustainability. The best ideas We look for the best ideas. First Venture's team evaluates hundreds of companies per year. Ready for future challenges The entrepreneurs An entrepreneurial team is crucial to the success of a startup. So we at First Venture spend a lot of time evaluating an entrepreneurial team before finalizing the investment. Early on First Venture has been the first institutional investor in many companies. However, this is not a criterion for investment and in many cases First Venture co-invests with other local and international venture capital investors. Swedish innovation, Global Vision Market First Venture invests in Sweden-based companies with products or services that have global potential. Strategy Investment Strategy First Venture believes that technology has an extraordinary power to transform industries and improve people's lives. We invest in pioneering companies in digital technology, health and sustainability that have a strong vision and a clear sustainability profile. Our investment strategy is focused on identifying and supporting startups and companies that have the potential to revolutionize their industries and create positive change. We believe in being a catalyst for progress and in making investments that not only provide good returns, but also contribute to a better future for society. Three megatrends First Venture is dedicated to focusing on technology, health and sustainability. These three megatrends will continue to drive society and business. Minority ownership First Venture seeks minority stakes in its portfolio companies to ensure appropriate incentives for entrepreneurs. Growth companies First Venture focuses on companies that are at the brink of or are in strong growth curve. Long-term Partner First Ventures has a structure and philosophy that allows us to be truly long-term in our investments. When the time is right for investment ------------------------------------- First Venture focuses on investing at the bottom of the \"Valley of Death\". It is a challenging period for companies where reversing the negative cash flow trend is a possible, but not easy task. To survive this phase, companies need capital to develop and expand their teams and strengthen their sales and marketing resources. First Venture sees this as a promising opportunity to invest as there is less competition and potential for higher value growth. Valley of Death The Valley of Death is the lowest point on an aggregate cash flow curve and shows the typical economic development for a startup or scaling company. Right timing for investors By combining an investment in a company currently in the Valley of Death with an infusion of capital and know-how, the company is well-positioned for rapid value growth. Right timing for Entrepreneurs The typical situation with the Valley of Death occurs just before a company's product or service is commercialized. At this point, entrepreneurs are the most open to active investors.

We analyze each investment and company individually from a sustainability perspective and we only invest in companies that we believe meet our investment criteria. First Venture refers to an analysis model to review how the company complies with international conventions and guidelines for environment, social responsibility and corporate governance (ESG) and also the UN Global Compact including some of the UN principles for sustainable development goals (SDG). These frameworks are in turn based on international standards for the environment, human rights, labor and corruption. First Venture's operations shall be conducted in a way that is economically, socially and environmentally sustainable because we also want to contribute to a sustainable society. This means, among other things, that First Venture takes into account the needs of both current and future generations and that we take long-term responsibility for our daily work.

Dessa megatrender spelar en avgörande roll för att skapa en bättre värld för oss alla. Vi på First Venture förstår kraften i den digitala tekniken och har insett att den är en nyckelfaktor för att driva framsteg inom hälsa och hållbarhet. Genom att investera tidigt i innovativa teknikföretag är vi med och formar framtidens landskap inom dessa områden. Tre megatrender First Venture fokuserar på teknik, hälsa och hållbarhet. Vi investerar i bolag med potential att skapa positiv förändring, bidra till hållbar utveckling och förbättrad hälsa. Vi tror att dessa tre megatrender kommer fortsätta påverka samhället och affärsvärlden, och vill stödja bolag som kan göra verklig skillnad. Fokusområde \"Valley of death\" Endast 1 av 9 nystartade företag överlever ”Valley of death” vilket kan verka skrämmande men visar hur svårt det är att lyckas övertyga marknaden med en ny produkt. Alla företag hamnar i denna utförsbacke och att vända trenden är inte lätt, men dock möjlig uppgift. För att klara sig genom dalen behöver dessa företag kapital, främst för att utveckla och växa sina team, men också för att öka sina försäljnings- och marknadsföringsresurser. Onoterade och noterade First Venture investerar i både onoterade och noterade bolag. Vi har omfattande erfarenhet av båda typer av bolag och är ett attraktivt val för entreprenörer som söker finansiering. Som en långsiktig och aktiv ägare arbetar vi nära våra portföljbolag för att stödja dem i att nå sina mål. News from our universe ---------------------- Ett urval av våra aktiva innehav -------------------------------- \"First Venture är en långsiktig och aktiv ägare som har ett nära samarbete med entreprenörsteamen i portföljbolagen.\" First Ventures erfarna team har arbetat med investeringar i många år. Investerarteamet tillsammans med First Ventures nätverk av rådgivare har djup, relevant och bred kunskap inom teknik, hälsa och hållbarhet. Vanliga frågor & mer om oss --------------------------- Vad är \"Valley of Death\" \"Valley of Death\" (Dödens dal) är en situation när ett företag, särskilt inom teknik- eller innovationssektorn, står inför svårigheter att säkra tillräcklig finansiering under en specifik fas i sin utveckling. Det inträffar efter forskning och utveckling när företaget behöver kapital för att ta sin produkt till marknaden. Endast 1 av 9 nystartade företag överlever ”Valley of Death” vilket kan verka skrämmande men visar hur svårt det är att lyckas övertyga marknaden med en ny produkt. Alla företag hamnar i denna \"utförsbacke\" och att vända trenden är ingen lätt, men dock möjlig uppgift. För att klara sig genom dalen behöver dessa företag kapital, främst för att utveckla och växa sina team, men också för att öka sina försäljnings- och marknadsföringsresurser. Vilka branscher investerar First Venture i? First Venture investerar inom teknik, hälsa och hållbarhet, tre megatrender som hjälper till att främja en bättre framtid för mänskligheten. Framförallt digitalteknikens utveckling och digitaliseringen har haft stor betydelse för många branscher och är viktig för utveckling inom hälsa och hållbarhet. Hälsa är inte bara läkemedel och sjukvård utan även förebyggande åtgärder som kosthållning och träning. Hållbarhet eller Sustaintech som kan definieras som hållbarhet och livskvalitet genom teknik, är en trend som bara ökar i betydelse och det är bråttom för mänskligheten. Vi måste agera nu och det finns många tidiga svenska tillväxtbolag med innovativa lösningar och produkter. Investerar First Venture i både onoterade och noterade bolag? First Venture investerar i både onoterade och noterade tillväxtbolag inom teknik, hälsa och hållbarhet. I de onoterade bolagen drivs ofta ett mycket aktivt arbete via styrelsen och coaching av entreprenörsteamet för att öka tillväxttakten. En notering av bolaget ska gärna vara möjlig inom en treårsperiod och entreprenörsteamet ska vara redo att gå den vägen. Generellt går First Venture in som minoritetsägare och sätter stor vikt vid att entreprenörsteamet är stora ägare vid investering. I de noterade bolagen kommer First Venture företrädesvis vara aktiva via valberedningen snarare än styrelsen för att underlätta en aktiv förvaltning av aktierna i portföljbolagen. Däremot har man fortsatt en nära kontakt med entreprenörsteamet löpande. En notering innebär också en god möjlighet för bolagen att applicera en förvärvsstrategi för att snabba på tillväxttakten. Hur vi jobbar med hållbarhet First Venture integrerar aktivt hållbarhet i alla sina investeringar. Varje investering och företag analyseras individuellt utifrån hållbarhetsperspektiv för att säkerställa att de uppfyller investeringskriterierna. Vi anser att företag som inte är hållbara på sikt inte kan växa på samma nivå och möta kapitalavkastningskrav, vilket kan leda till finansierings- och investeringsproblem. Vi refererar ofta till en analysmodell för att granska företags efterlevnad av internationella ESG-riktlinjer och FN:s Global Compact, inklusive principer för hållbara utvecklingsmål. Vi tar ansvar för nuvarande och framtida generationers behov och arbetar på lång sikt. Vi har hög moral och god affärsetik som präglar hela vår verksamhet. Vi följer gällande lagstiftning och andra bestämmelser som minimikrav. Våra gemensamma värderingar bygger på öppenhet, ärlighet och ödmjukhet och genomsyrar vårt dagliga arbete både internt och externt. Vad är First Ventures substansvärde? First Ventures substansvärde per aktie uppgick per den 31 oktober 2023 till 5,73 kr/aktie. Rabatten i förhållande till börskursen var 54,1 %. First Ventures avkastning på substansvärdet för 2023 uppgår till -5,5 %. First North All-share Index avkastade -17,8 % under samma period."

The group launches Idrica, a suite spin-off of software solutions aiming to bring the future to the water sector. A second 60 million euros fund was created and with it, GoHub Ventures was born.

We invest in and develop both infrastructure through Radforsk Innovation and companies through Radforsk Invest, and connect businesses with cutting-edge research environments and entrepreneurs. We are present in the entire value chain, from research in the academic institutions to start-up companies and into the commercial sphere. In this way, we gain unique knowledge and expertise to increase the value of a complex process at all stages. We are neither like other ecosystem builders nor investors, as we tend to say: \"We don't think outside the box, for us there is no box\". Radforsk works to bring new cancer treatment from the laboratory to the market and to the patients who need it. One of the most important things we do is to identify and invest in promising technologies and companies that have the potential to improve patient care. At the same time, we work to ensure that companies and research environments have the best possible infrastructure and development conditions in order to succeed in a global industry. Radforsk Invest's role goes far beyond traditional financing when we work to develop our portfolio companies. We are both investors, entrepreneurs and company developers. Ground-breaking new cancer treatment takes time to develop, and with our evergreen model we are long-term. We contribute strategically and operationally both before, during and after the establishment of companies. Radforsk Invest has a global approach to our investments. Radforsk Innovation builds ecosystems and infrastructure that enable ground-breaking research and innovation. Radforsk Innovation is behind the national cancer cluster Oslo Cancer Cluster, the incubator Oslo Cancer Cluster Incubator, and not least the Oslo Cancer Cluster Innovation Park, which houses Ullern high school, units at Oslo University Hospital, the Cancer Registry and large and small private companies that develop cancer treatment. The Oslo Cancer Cluster Innovation Park is an important part of Campus Radiumhospitalet, and is constantly expanding as more start-up companies are established and more international companies want to take part in the unique environment that has existed here at Montebello since the start in the 1930s. Read more about this in our story. Radforsk has a very special position in the health industry in Norway, and we work politically consciously to help strengthen this important industry, alone and in collaboration with a wide range of actors. Through our work, we want to contribute to a paradigm shift in cancer treatment by developing the most promising innovations and research initiatives. We believe that through strategic investments and an irrepressible commitment, we can make a real difference to treating cancer better than today. Cancer is a disease that affects so many people - not only here in Norway, but all over the world. We are hugely motivated by the opportunity to improve the lives of cancer patients and their relatives. Team ---- Jònas Einarsson is the CEO of Radforsk, a position he has held since 2002.

Our mandate was then to handle the commercialization of the research at Radiumhospitalet, as well as the contractual and financial aspects of the clinical industrial studies at the hospital. We had this role until 2007, when these functions were brought together at Oslo University Hospital. Under the leadership of Jónas Einarsson, who takes over as CEO in 2002, we are developing into the player we are today: An active investor who develops companies in close collaboration with researchers and an ecosystem builder. Einarsson thus joins the ranks of visionary leaders at Radiumhospitalet who have great ambitions on behalf of cancer patients, and take unconventional steps to realize them. In the nearly 40 years we have existed, we have helped shape the development of Norwegian cancer research and development in a very special way. In this work, however, we stand on the shoulders of giants, where we have continued a proud tradition of thinking outside the box, because we do not believe in the concept of a box, in order to offer cancer patients better cancer treatment. Our history is strongly linked to the history of the Radium Hospital, and not least the story of how zealots at the beginning of the 20th century ensured that Norwegian cancer patients received treatment with the newest cancer treatment available at the time, radium. 1903 Marie Curie and Ellen Gleditch 1903 To tell Radforsk's story, it is necessary to first describe how modern cancer treatment developed in Norway and at the Radium Hospital. We therefore start with the story of Marie Curie and the year 1903. That was the year when she determined the atomic weight of the radioactive element radium, which she and her husband Pierre Curie discovered a few years earlier. They also found that the radiation from radium could treat cancer. Between 1907 and 1912, the Norwegian pharmacist and chemist Ellen Gleditch worked in Madame Curie's laboratory in Paris, a position she was appointed to despite keen international competition for the post. And it was with Gleditch's help that Rikshospitalet hospital in Oslo gained access to radium. The first patient to be treated with radium was discharged in October 1912 × 1913 Doctors Huitfeldt and Heyerdahl 1913 Severin Andreas Heyerdahl and Hans Ludvig Carl Huitfeldt were both members of staff at Rikshospitalet hospital. As young doctors, they kept up to date with all the news from Europe about new diagnostic and treatment methods for cancer, and believed that Rikshospitalet had to acquire both an X-ray machine and radium. Not everyone agreed, however. Despite this opposition, they managed, with Ellen Gleditch's help, to get hold of both radium and an X-ray machine. The number of cancer patients was large and increasing, however, and Heyerdahl and Huitfeldt wanted to offer them better treatment. They again met with opposition at Rikshospitalet. They therefore started a private clinic in 1913, Kristiania Radiuminstitutt. In 1913, Amandus Schibsted, editor of the newspaper Aftenposten, established a fund of NOK 15,000 for the purchase of radium. Schibsted was Huitfeldt's father in law and, during the period up to 1932, Aftenposten and the two doctors came to play a decisive role in the establishment and building of the Norwegian Radium Hospital. Some people believe that the history of the Norwegian Radium Hospital dates back to the establishment of this fund in 1913, despite the long drawn-out building process and the hospital not formally opening until 1932. × 1932 The Norwegian Radium Hospital 1932 Finally, after several fund-raising campaigns among the Norwegian public to finance the construction of the hospital building, the Norwegian Radium Hospital opened at Montebello. And no less a figure than King Haakon VII himself formally inaugurated the hospital. When it opened, the hospital had 71 beds and a separate gynaecological department. The staff totalled 49, and it had, by the standards of the time, an advanced laboratory with pathology functions. Severin Andreas Heyerdahl was the hospital's first director, a position he held until 1940. × 1948 Reidar Eker was the prime mover behind the Radium Hospital's further development. His ambition was to build a world-class cancer centre, a task he largely accomplished. In the early 1950s, a public committee was appointed to assess whether the Radium Hospital should be further developed. Such development would strongly increase the size of the hospital and its capacity to treat several types of cancer. The alternative was to establish specialist departments across the country. Eker worked purposefully and the committee finally recommended expanding the Radium Hospital, introducing a new type of radiation treatment and increasing capacity to 300 patient beds. The problem was once again that the national economy was unable to bear the costs. During the years 1951–1952, a nationwide fund-raising campaign was held in cooperation with Norway's national broadcaster NRK. In addition, the Norwegian parliament, the Storting, passed a special act granting tax exemption for contributions to the fund-raising campaign. This was the fourth time that appeals were made to public to fund the hospital. This time, it was King Olav who attended the opening ceremony in 1958. Aftenposten reported the event with an article headlined: 'The Norwegian Radium Hospital – the Norwegian people's gift to itself'. Director Eker and the other staff who worked at the hospital at this time created an enthusiastic environment, where everyone wanted to do their best for an important cause. This became an important part of the spirit and culture of the Radium Hospital. × 1951 The Cancer Registry of Norway 1951 The Cancer Registry of Norway was established at the Norwegian Radium Hospital in 1951 as one of the first such registries in the world. It was the Norwegian Cancer Society that took the initiative for the establishment of the Cancer Registry. The first cancer cases were registered in early 1952. There were two reasons in particular why the Association wanted to establish a cancer registry: to facilitate epidemiological research and for administrative purposes. The Norwegian Cancer Society was responsible for running the Cancer Registry until the State took over in 1979. × 1954 Hydro – the Institute for Cancer Research 1954 It was director Eker who came up with the idea for a research institute at the Radium Hospital and who brought it to fruition. Just after World War II, little was known about what mechanisms drove the development of cancer, and how cancer cells could be subdued. Eker launched the idea of an interdisciplinary approach, where knowledge from key fields such as biochemistry, biophysics and genetics would be drawn on in parallel with pathology and clinical medicine. Funding was lacking, however. Director Eker consulted Managing Director Bjarne Eriksen of the company Norsk Hydro A/S, who made funds available for building new research premises side by side with the original clinic building. × 1983 Jan Vincents Johannessen 1983 In 1983, yet another doctor and pathologist was appointed as director of the Radium Hospital. He would join the ranks of visionary leaders who had spearheaded the hospital's development. Jan Vincents Johannessen has always been known for his wealth of ideas, ideas that proved very useful in a time when increasing state control of the hospital sector was strongly advocated. During that period, he inspired dedication among staff through frequent contact and discussions with all the professions. Jan, as everyone addressed him, began buying up plots of land in an area called Vestenghaugen, where the Institute for Cancer Research was built, opening in 2009. He realised at an early stage that the then Radium Hospital was too small to house all the research that went on there in addition to ordinary patient treatment. Jan was also known for his tireless efforts to establish activities aimed at promoting the wellbeing of patients and their families, such as the bus and car service for patients, the art library, wellbeing centre, a swimming pool, 'gourmet food', recreational activities, a youth room and the Montebello Centre. × 1987 The Norwegian Radium Hospital's Research Foundation 1987 The Norwegian Radium Hospital's Research Foundation was established in 1987 to serve as a technology transfer office for the Radium Hospital. This involved attending to the commercialisation of research at the Radium Hospital, and to contractual and financial aspects of the clinical trials conducted at the hospital. The Foundation's start-up capital was one million kroner. Today, this capital has been converted into a substantial portfolio of innovative, cancer-related companies. In addition, through its work, the Foundation has awarded NOK 237 million of its profits to researchers and innovative research projects. × 1997 Roy Larsen and Øyvind Bruland formed the company Algeta to develop the first radiopharmaceutical treatment of prostate cancer skeletal metastasis, which is now marketed by Bayer as Xofigo. This was the start of a fantastic collaboration between Larsen and Bruland, which to date has led to the formation of many other radiopharmaceutical companies, such as Nordic Nanovector, Oncoinvent and ArtBio. It was also the beginning of a unique development in the history of the Norwegian health industry, which led to marketing approval for the drug Xofigo in 2013 and to Bayer's acquisition of Algeta in 2014 – and many other positive ripple effects. × 2000 Photocure was listed on the Oslo stock exchange, Oslo børs, in 2000. It was the first company in Radforsk's portfolio to be listed – a huge milestone for them, for us and for Norwegian cancer treatment. The company, which is a spin-off of the research conducted at the Institute for Cancer Research, has developed both photodynamic therapy for skin cancer and a combined product that is used to get cancer cells in the bladder to glow pink, making it easier for surgeons to see and remove them. × 2006 Oslo Cancer Cluster formed 2006 Kaare Norum, former rector of the University of Oslo, and Jónas Einarsson, managing director of Radforsk Research Foundation, established Oslo Cancer Cluster as a national cancer research and development cluster. In 2007, the cluster was awarded the status of 'Norwegian Centre of Excellence' with support from Innovation Norway, the Research Council of Norway and SIVA. Within a short space of time, it succeeded in bringing on board large public hospitals and research institutions, biotech companies and major international pharmaceutical companies as members. × 2007 Nykode Therapeutics (formerly Vaccibody) 2007 The company Nykode Therapeutics was formed in 2007, based on research at the University of Oslo and Oslo University Hospital conducted by Professor Bjarne Bogen, Professor Emerita Ingrid Sandlie and research fellow Agnete Brunsvik Fredriksen. Brunsvik Fredriksen later became a full-time employee of the company and is now its Chief Business Officer. Nykode is now developing an innovative vaccine platform where vaccines are steered to the antigen-presenting cells to produce faster, stronger and more long-lasting immune responses. × 2009 'Window of hope' opened 2009 There had long been a need to bring together the researchers at the Institute of Cancer Research in a separate building with both offices and laboratory facilities. In 2009, Queen Sonja opened the new building side by side with the Radium Hospital, which the researchers call 'Håpets vindu' (Window of Hope). It was the former director of the Radium Hospital, Jan Vincents Johannessen, who made this possible through the Norwegian Radium Hospital Foundation's purchases of plots of land in the area previously known as Vestenghaugen. × 2009 Collaboration between Oslo Cancer Cluster and Ullern Upper Secondary School 2009 Ullern Upper Secondary School and the Norwegian Radium Hospital had been neighbours since 1932 without the two institutions having any contact with each other. After the establishment of Oslo Cancer Cluster in 2006 as a network organisation, Norum and Einarsson had shared a dream: to have a physical building next door to the Radium Hospital and the Institute for Cancer Research where small and large companies could move in and cooperate closely with the researchers and clinicians at the hospital and the institute. Towards the end of the 2000s, Norum heard from a grandchild of his who was a student at Ullern Upper Secondary School that there were plans to refurbish the school. That gave him the idea of integrating the school in the new building he and Einarsson dreamed of. After a prolonged political process in the City of Oslo, the plans were given the go ahead, and work on building Oslo Cancer Cluster Innovation Park could begin. Long before the new building was completed, a binding educational collaboration was established between the school and Oslo Cancer Cluster with the aim of educating the entrepreneurs and researchers of the future. × 2014 Bayer acquires Algeta 2014 As early as 2009, Bayer entered into a collaboration with Algeta on developing Xofigo all the way to the market. Xofigo is the name given to a radiopharmaceutical drug for the treatment of prostate cancer patients with skeletal metastasis. It was developed by Roy Larsen and Øyvind Bruland. The randomised Phase III trial of the drug was stopped for ethical reasons, because the patients who were given Xofigo experienced such a good effect compared with those who were only given a placebo. Things progressed apace after that: In 2013, Xofigo was granted marketing approval as the first alpha-emitting drug in the world, and in 2014 Bayer acquired Algeta. Many of Algeta's employees were taken on by Bayer, and Bayer focused strongly on research into and the development of radiopharmaceuticals in Norway. × 2015 Prime Minister Erna Solberg opens Oslo Cancer Cluster Innovation Park 2015 Oslo Cancer Cluster Innovation Park was formally opened on 25 August 2015 by Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg. The building, which was almost fully occupied already upon completion, houses parts of Oslo University Hospital that are dedicated to cancer research, the hospital pharmacy for the Radium Hospital, the Cancer Registry of Norway, Ullern Upper Secondary School, Oslo Cancer Cluster Incubator and a number of companies engaged in developing cancer treatments. × 2020 The Nykode Agreement with Genentech 2020 In October 2020, Nykode entered into an agreement for the development of individually tailored cancer vaccines with the American biotech company Genentech, which is part of the Roche group. Worth USD 715 million in addition to royalties on the sale of products, it was the biggest agreement any Norwegian biotech company had ever signed. × 2023 The Ellen Gleditch Cyclotron in place 2023 The new Radium Hospital is scheduled for completion in 2024. The hospital has been further developed as a specialised cancer hospital with a new clinical and proton therapy building. Proton therapy has not previously been possible in Norway. This therapy requires a cyclotron weighing all of 100 tonnes It has been named Ellen Gleditch after the researcher who worked with Marie Curie and ensured that Norway had access to radium for the first time. The cyclotron was made in Germany and transported to Norway in 2023, where it was set up in the building's basement. × 2023 ARTBIO, a new radiopharmaceutical adventure 2023 In spring 2023, Radforsk and the American specialist investors F-Prime and Omega launched the radiopharmaceutical company ARTBIO. The company is based on research by Roy Larsen and Øyvind Bruland, who are behind both Algeta and a number of other companies in the field. In December the same year, the company reported that it has raised almost NOK 1 billion from new American specialist investors, including Third Rock Ventures, in addition to the existing investors. The company plans to develop radiopharmaceutical cancer treatment. Its headquarters are in Boston, while it has a development department in Oslo and branches in London and Basel. × 2024 Completion of the new Radium Hospital 2024 The new Radium Hospital is scheduled for completion in 2024. The hospital has been further developed as a specialised cancer hospital with a new clinical and proton therapy building. × 2025 Oslo Cancer Cluster Innovation Park, Block 4 2025 The first extension of Oslo Cancer Cluster Innovation Park is scheduled for completion in 2025. Several of Thermo Fisher Scientific's research and development departments will be among those moving in, as well as Oslo Cancer Cluster Incubator's companies that work on immune therapy, the Aktiv mot Kreft (Active against Cancer) foundation and a number of others. Tenants have already been found for the whole building. × 2030 Oslo Science Hub opens 2030 Oslo Science Hub is the latest expansion of Campus Radiumhospitalet and will contribute to transforming the campus into a micro-neighbourhood. Oslo Science Hub will provide Campus Radiumhospitalet with a highly anticipated expansion of space, including office areas, laboratories, a biobank, and a researcher hotel, specifically tailored for international and national players in cancer research and development. Additionally, Oslo Science Hub will contribute to transforming the campus into a pleasant micro-neighbourhood with a convenience store, café, restaurants, and a square.

Our two primary goals for Radforsk Innovation are to secure access to new, innovative ideas that can develop into ground-breaking projects and companies, and to provide our portfolio companies with the best conditions for growth. For Radforsk Invest, this means getting: The best possible access to new ideas and research that can form the basis for company establishment and investments The best possible development conditions for Radforsk Invest's portfolio companies, such as infrastructure, access to talent and other framework conditions. When we see the potential in a new field of research or discover a bottleneck in a system, we exploit the potential or solve the bottleneck. We step in directly with investments and research funds, alone or together with others. We connect people, companies and technologies, national and international - and our driving force is always to develop the best possible treatment for cancer patients. Below you will find an overview of our innovations - those we are proud to have already built, and those we are excited to develop further. Campus Radiumhospitalet ----------------------- Campus Radiumhospitalet is an epicenter for cancer research and development in Norway. Overall, Campus Radiumhospitalet strengthens Norway's position in cancer research and contributes significantly to both the European and global efforts to develop new and more effective treatments for cancer. In Text: our history, URL: https://radforsk-app.staging.servd.dev/about-us#our-history you can read more about this area at Montebello in Oslo and how it has developed from when Radiumhospitalet opened its doors in 1932 to today, and what are the future plans on Campus. Below we have described the various parts that make up the Campus, and make the area completely unique: ### Oslo Cancer Cluster Innovation Park Oslo Cancer Cluster Innovation Park, which opened in 2015, houses parts of Oslo University Hospital, the Cancer Registry of Norway, Oslo Cancer Cluster Incubator, large and small companies, and Ullern Upper Secondary School. ### Oslo Cancer Cluster Innovation Park The park is located beside the Norwegian Radium Hospital and the Institute for Cancer Research. This facilitates direct contact between private enterprises and the research and treatment that is carried out here, which serves as a catalyst for collaboration between the private sector, research and clinical trials. Here, there are specialised laboratories, shared offices and arenas that promote innovation and the commercialisation of new cancer therapies. The prime movers behind the innovation park and the integration of Ullern Upper Secondary School were Jónas Einarsson and Kaare Norum, who were also behind Oslo Cancer Cluster. As far as we know, this type of concept is still highly unusual in Norway, and both politicians and others engaged in developing innovation environments use our model as inspiration when developing corresponding building complexes elsewhere. The Innovation Park was soon fully occupied and interest in becoming part of this milieu keeps increasing. Einarsson has, recently also together with Thomas London of Oslo Science Hub, therefore been working hard to expand the park. Construction work on the first new building started in summer 2023 and is scheduled for completion in 2025. The new building will have around 12,000 sq. m of floor space and will, among other things, house Thermo Fisher Scientific's research department, the Aktiv mot Kreft (Active against Cancer) foundation and the companies in Oslo Cancer Cluster Incubator that are working on cell therapy.[](https://occinnovationpark.com/) Text: Read more., URL: https://occinnovationpark.com/ × ### Oslo Cancer Cluster Incubator Oslo Cancer Cluster Incubator started on a modest scale when the management of Radforsk and Oslo Cancer Cluster shared premises at Lysakerlokket between 2010 and 2015, before moving to Oslo Cancer Cluster Innovation Park. ### Oslo Cancer Cluster Incubator The Incubator offers resources, networks and know-how that is essential for new and growing enterprises in the industry, such as laboratories with specialised machinery and equipment, offices, meeting rooms and dedicated staff. Because of shortage of space at Montebello, some of the companies are based at Rebell in central Oslo pending the expansion of the Innovation Park. [](https://occincubator.com/) Text: Read more., URL: https://occincubator.com/ × ### Oslo Science Hub In 2030, yet another expansion of Campus Radiumhospitalet is scheduled for completion. ### Oslo Science Hub Oslo Science Hub represents an expansion of Campus Radiumhospitalet with 40,000 square meters and potentially 2,000 new jobs. Oslo Science Hub will provide Campus Radiumhospitalet with a highly anticipated expansion of space, including office areas, laboratories, a biobank, and a researcher hotel, specifically tailored for international and national actors in cancer research and development. Additionally, Oslo Science Hub will contribute to transforming the campus into a pleasant micro-neighbourhood with a convenience store, café, restaurants, and a square. Thomas London (pictured above) is the CEO of Oslo Science Hub. London works closely with Jónas Einarsson, CEO of Radforsk, on this project. Text: Read more about the project here., URL: https://oslocancercluster.no/2024/08/16/new-plans-for-the-radium-hospital-campus/ × ### Institute for Cancer Research Since it was founded in 1954, the Institute for Cancer Research has played a key role in both Norwegian and international cancer research. ### Institute for Cancer Research The institute currently has seven research departments and more than 340 employees. The institute for Cancer Research has strong international research groups in the fields of biochemistry, cell and tumour biology, genetics, radiation biology, immunology and cancer prevention. Since its establishment, the institute's researchers have cooperated closely with cancer surgeons, oncologists and pathologists. The emphasis on translational research has resulted in a number of clinical protocols based on in-house research. This institute is a key partner in what is known as CCC – Comprehensive Cancer Centre at Oslo University Hospital.[](https://www.oslo-universitetssykehus.no/avdelinger/kreftklinikken/institutt-for-kreftforskning/) Text: Read more., URL: https://www.oslo-universitetssykehus.no/avdelinger/kreftklinikken/institutt-for-kreftforskning/ × ### The Norwegian Radium Hospital The Norwegian Radium Hospital, which was opened in 1932, is a highly respected cancer hospital and is now regarded as the biggest cancer centre in Scandinavia. ### The Norwegian Radium Hospital The hospital was inaugurated as Norway's first specialist hospital for cancer treatment by King Haakon VII, and Severin Andreas Heyerdahl was its first director. The hospital originally had room for 71 patients, but has since been considerably expanded. The new Radium Hospital opens in September 2024, and will now also offer proton therapy.[](https://www.oslo-universitetssykehus.no/steder/radiumhospitalet) Text: Read more., URL: https://www.oslo-universitetssykehus.no/steder/radiumhospitalet × Strategic allocations --------------------- To date, the profit from our operations has contributed over NOK 237 million to research and strategic projects at Oslo University Hospital. Below you can see an overview of what these funds have been used for over time. ### Photodynamic therapy and photochemical internalization Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photochemical internalization (PCI) are cancer treatments that use light to deliver anticancer drugs to cells or organs. ### The Test Unit The trial unit at Radiumhospitalet is part of the Section for experimental cancer treatment at Oslo University Hospital. This section aims to offer patients treatment within the framework of clinical studies, and works closely with the pharmaceutical industry and other research environments, both nationally and internationally. ### Immunomonitoring Department The immunomonitoring department does complete preclinical studies for immunotherapeutic molecules such as vaccines and adoptive T-cell transfer (TCR, CAR). ### TARACAN TARACAN is an abbreviation for \"Targeted Radionuclide Therapy (TRT)\". This project takes place at the Cancer Clinic and Clinic for Radiology and Nuclear Medicine at Oslo University Hospital. ### The ACT Centre The ACT Center is a national center for advanced cell therapy that will offer patients from all over Norway pioneering and potentially life-saving treatment. Cell therapy represents a major breakthrough in modern cancer treatment, especially for lymphatic and blood cancers. ### Research projects at the Comprehensive Cancer Center This is an award that goes back in time. Oslo Cancer Cluster ------------------- Oslo Cancer Cluster is a leading innovation cluster in Norway, specialized in cancer research and development of cancer treatment. It was Jónas Einarsson and the now deceased Kaare Norum who took the initiative to establish the cluster in 2006. They secured funds for the start-up through an application to Innovation Norway, SIVA and the Research Council. The cluster is a collaborative body consisting of hospitals, research institutions, biotechnology companies and academic environments that work together to accelerate the development of new cancer treatments and diagnostics. The cluster's aim is to create a better future for cancer patients by combining expertise from different sectors to support innovation and commercialization of research-based cancer therapies. With membership that spans the private and public sectors, the Oslo Cancer Cluster facilitates synergies between research, capital and clinical practice. Oslo Cancer Cluster is behind a number of projects, national and local, which support the purpose of the cluster. Read more about Oslo Cancer Cluster. Text: oslocancercluster.com, URL: https://oslocancercluster.no/ Educational collaboration ------------------------- In 2009, an educational collaboration was established between the Oslo Cancer Cluster and Ullern Upper Secondary School, as part of the establishment of the Oslo Cancer Cluster Innovation Park. This collaboration gives the students at Ullern the opportunity to participate in placements and practical work at both hospitals, universities and in private companies, in addition to visits and lectures. The purpose of the school academic collaboration is to contribute to knowledge and inspiration to think about a further career path in health, be it as a researcher, nurse, communications advisor, entrepreneur, doctor, bioinformatician - or something else entirely. In 2015, Oslo Cancer Cluster and Ullern high school were co-located in Oslo Cancer Cluster Innovation Park. The collaboration took on a new dimension called \"Life in the park\": Pupils, teachers, cancer researchers, clinicians and employees of companies that develop innovative cancer treatment share a canteen and a multi-purpose hall - and meet each other in various projects. In 2019, Forskerlinja opened, a targeted offer for young people with an interest in research and science, and here the students get a number of unique offers, and they are followed by their own mentors drawn from the environment in and around the Oslo Cancer Cluster. Jónas Einarsson, managing director of Radforsk, is one of the mentors who accompany the students at Forskerlinja. Read more about the cooperation.

We are entrepreneurs. We build companies. ----------------------------------------------------------- Radforsk Invest invests in and builds companies that develop groundbreaking treatment methods and tools that will address unmet medical needs. We take a holistic, long-term approach and do not shy away from risk. We focus in particular on immune therapy, radiopharmaceutical treatment and precision medicine. Radforsk Invest uses an evergreen model. This means that the proceeds from successful business ventures are ploughed into financing and developing new portfolio companies, further investments in the existing portfolio, and projects under the auspices of Radforsk Innovation. We do things differently. Because we believe in our approach. And because we dare. So far, we have built companies in the Nordic countries, Europe and the USA. We have been involved in nine stock exchange listings, and we have helped to take a number of products to the global market. We found and develop biotech companies that develop drugs, treatment methods and tools that do not exist today, and that have the potential to make a real difference for patients. We do so either because we, together with innovative researchers and entrepreneurs, are ahead of the field, or because we take a contrary approach where others dare not tread or lack belief, while we dare to do so. Minor improvements and candidate drugs that many others develop are not for us. We develop innovative drugs that meet significant medical needs, and we focus on technologies based on new approaches. Active management ----------------- Radforsk Invest exercises active management in all the phases of a company's development, from its establishment to the commercial phase We take a collaborative approach and bring together world-class, scientific, medical, industrial and commercial experience and expertise, both locally and globally. During the establishment phase, we often take on interim leadership roles while putting together a competent management team and organisation. We are concerned with recruiting the best expertise available, and our portfolio companies recruit people from all over the world. A comprehensive toolbox The Radforsk model, whereby we, through Radforsk Innovation, are ecosystem builders, ensures that we have good access to ideas, that we stimulate groundbreaking research and, not least, that we make continuous efforts to ensure that Radforsk Invest's portfolio companies have the best possible conditions for development. Portfolio Our companies ------------- Radforsk Invest is flexible in its ownership of portfolio companies, and it plays an active ownership role if this adds value for the company in question. We have both sold companies shortly after their formation, which we did in the case of OncoImmunity which was sold to NEC in 2019, and been active owners for more than 20 years, as in the case of Photocure. To make a difference, we cooperate with exceptional individuals and organisations with high implementation capability and tireless commitment. 237 MNOK allocated to cancer research ------------------------------------- So far, Radforsk has allocated NOK 237 million to innovative research projects and Centres of Excellence, which, in turn, have resulted in new ideas and technologies that form the basis for the new start-ups we develop. As part of the model and our close collaboration with researchers, in addition to financial support, we also give extensive advice to projects before companies are formed. Portfolio Our companies ------------- We have a broad portfolio of companies developing innovative cancer treatments based on excellent research. Our companies are especially strong within immuno-oncology, photodynamic therapy and radionuclides. We have been part of nine initial public offering, IPOs.

    "source_text": "Content from a-word-from-the-ceo.md Title: A word from the CEO URL Source: https://www.saminvest.se/en/a-word-from-the-ceo/ Markdown Content: The role of Saminvest as an anchor investor in privately managed venture capital funds is still important, which was also evident in the past year when Saminvest was an early investor in five new funds. The world economy in 2023 faced significant challenges, with war in our near area, high inflation and a high interest rate situation, which has made it difficult to access risk capital, negatively affected risk appetite and caused the transaction market to be slowed down significantly. Since its inception seven years ago, Saminvest has committed almost 4,800 million kronor in 24 funds and 12 angel investment companies, with a geographical spread from Luleå in the north to Malmö and Lund in the south. Together with private investors, Saminvest has contributed to more than 540 innovative companies receiving venture capital, which has enabled approximately 4,400 Swedish jobs. In addition, there have been successful divestments of the previously directly owned holdings, whose capital can now be used for fund investment activities. All in all, a solid foundation has been laid during these years. As the newly appointed CEO, I look forward to continuing to develop the business together with my employees. During the past year, Saminvest committed approximately 760 million kronor to five funds focused on investments in life science and tech, as well as a new area in impact with so-called outcome-based contracts. There is an increasing element of specialization in the funds’ investment orientations, which is an interesting development of the ecosystem. At the end of the previous year, approximately half of Saminvest’s committed capital was to funds with a technology focus, just under a third to life science funds and the remainder to funds with a climate and impact focus. The difficult state of the world economy has caused significant challenges to raise capital for funds during the year, which has resulted in funds taking longer time to raise capital for their first close. This is also confirmed by Saminvest’s investment indicator, which is one of several tools to facilitate our assessment of where the capital is most useful. The outcome from the investment indicator shows that it is challenging to raise capital in most phases and most sectors, which is why Saminvest’s role as an anchor investor remains significant. Saminvest’s mission includes contributing to developing the risk capital market and its ecosystem throughout the country. As a part of this work, Saminvest has been an anchor investor and started a new business angel program and a new business angel company, Kick Capital I, in south-eastern Sweden together with Blekinge Business Incubator where also the incubators Företagsfabriken in Växjö and Kalmar Science Park are incorporated. Furthermore, Saminvest together with Uppsala Innovation Center has launched the second generation angel investment company Linnéa Capital II. At the end of the year, a milestone was also achieved when the first divestments were carried out in two portfolio companies with selected business angels. Saminvest works for increased gender balance within both funds and business angel programs. The proportion of women in the investment teams increased slightly during the year from 33% to 34%. The number of female CEOs in the funds’ portfolio companies increased from 17% to 19%. The number of female business angels during the year amounted to 111, or 28% of the total number of business angels, which is the same figure as in 2022. More female business angels and CEOs in the portfolio companies will over time have a positive impact on the proportion of women in the investment teams. Developments in sustainability are moving at a rapid pace, which is also reflected in dialogues with the fund teams, and the ambitions are gradually being turned up. Saminvest encourages the funds to quantify the impact of their investments on the sustainable development goals according to the UN’s Agenda 2030, and the percentage of funds that do so has increased during the year. A further four direct investments have been divested during the past year, and of the original portfolio of 67 holdings, only one holding remained at the end of the year. During the year, Saminvest’s strategic goals for sustainable value creation have been adjusted so that they extend to the year 2033 and a new target level has been set for committed capital. This is completely in line with Saminvest’s mission to strengthen the Swedish ecosystem for risk capital and enable innovative early-stage companies to have long-term access to venture capital. Saminvest is well equipped to act as an anchor investor in the coming years as well. March 2024, Magnus Skåninger, CEO Content from about-saminvest.md Title: About Saminvest URL Source: https://www.saminvest.se/en/about-saminvest/ Markdown Content: We develop the Swedish venture capital market --------------------------------------------- Saminvest helps stimulate private capital within areas of different industries and business sectors where, at the time of the investment, private capital is sufficiently lacking. This is done through investments in privately managed funds and angel investor programmes, in which Saminvest often acts as an anchor investor. We actively work to support the establishment of new management teams so that the Swedish venture capital ecosystem can grow and develop. Saminvest also places clearly defined requirements for funds to pursue sustainability in its investments and proactively increase gender equality in its teams. Our investments are based on market returns, which is an important prerequisite for private capital to want to co-invest with us. Saminvest currently manages assets of approximately 6 billion Swedish krona. Industry sectors and phases of investment ----------------------------------------- The needs of the market and principal areas of investment change over time. Therefore, our investment operations have to be flexible in terms of sectors, investment phases, and geographical areas. The investment funds and angel investors that we have worked with so far are active in a number of different sectors that range from Life Science to Tech. The angel investors focus on pre-seed and early seed funding, while the investment funds focus varies from seed to growth. Investment phases Saminvest’s role of supplementing the market means that our investment efforts are directed towards segments where, at the time of the investment, private capital is not sufficiently available. Saminvest’s focus is independent of the investment industry and can work with funds and angel investor programmes that are active in all the early phases of developing companies, from seed funding to early growth. Saminvest does not invest in funds that focus on loan-financed acquisitions, so-called buyouts. Content from angel-investor-programme.md Title: Angel investor programme URL Source: https://www.saminvest.se/en/angel-investor-programme/ Markdown Content: Angel investors provide knowledge, contacts, and capital to entrepreneurs and companies and are therefore important for the Swedish business community. It is thus natural for Saminvest to support Sweden’s angel investors. Saminvest’s angel investor programme helps develop the venture capital market and the investor community. This is because the angel investor programme strengthens and supplements the financing for hundreds of companies in development phases and engages hundreds of angel investors throughout Sweden. Saminvest’s investments in angel investors are based on commercial viability. The angel investors also contribute to increasing the sustainability of the business community. Saminvest also requires and follows up to ensure the angel investors actively work for increased gender equality and sustainable entrepreneurship. The angel investor programme is linked to some of the country’s leading incubators, which have spent many years developing expertise, networks, and infrastructure. All of these incubators are part of Vinnova’s national incubator program and are classified as excellent. They have a strong flow of companies moving through them and good connections with angel investors. Saminvest collaborates with Text: Arctic Business, URL: https://www.abi.se/ in Luleå, Text: Ideon Innovation, URL: https://www.ideoninnovation.se/ in Lund, Text: Minc, URL: https://www.minc.se/ in Malmö, Text: Sting, URL: https://sting.co/ in Stockholm and Text: Uppsala Innovation Centre, URL: https://uic.se/. Together, we create the conditions for new companies to grow and become successful. The majority of the incubators and certain angel investors are at the forefront of actively supporting and helping improve, among other things, gender equality among their teams and the senior executives of their portfolio companies, as well as the integration of sustainability in the companies’ business models. Overview -------- Initial investments In the first step, Saminvest and angel investors invest together in an angel investing corporation, which in turn invests in and builds a portfolio of start-up companies that undergo an incubator program. The angel investors thus gain, with a relatively small capital investment, an increased spread of risk in their investments as well as insight into and contacts with a large number of promising start-up companies. Follow-on investments In the second step, the angel investors evaluate which of the portfolio companies from the angel investing corporation they want to continue investing in and then make one or more follow-on investments in those companies. Some selected angel investors’ investments are matched by Saminvest. This is done for the same amount and on the same terms for each angel investor. Saminvest does not exercise any ownership power in these companies, but it is transferred to the selected and co-investing angel investor.

Content from fund-investment.md Title: Fund investment URL Source: https://www.saminvest.se/en/fund-investment/ Markdown Content: We are looking for new management teams of investment funds in Sweden --------------------------------------------------------------------- We are looking for management teams that are skilled business developers, can deliver high market returns, and contribute to the development of the venture capital market. Sweden needs more competent and capital-strong investors who have the will and ability to develop young companies. Saminvest invests in funds that invest in companies with high innovation capacity and growth potential within sectors that lack sufficient capital. We are a long-term investor in the funds we work with. Our investments are based on commercial viability. This is how we become a credible partner for private investors. By identifying investment funds with teams that have an understanding of innovation, broad networks, ownership experience, and the ability to deliver returns, we can help attract private investors to those funds. In our selection process, we analyse four important areas, which must have a good balance among themselves: the fund’s management team, parameters, market opportunities, and strategy. Management team The management team of an investment fund is a crucial factor and forms the core of a fund’s operations. Team members need to have relevant experience with similar investments and entrepreneurship. Saminvest attaches great importance to investment credentials and experience of all or parts of the team. A team also needs a positive work environment to stick together, preferably throughout the life cycles of several funds. Furthermore, the team’s network of contacts is central to being able to handle the many issues and challenges associated with investing in innovative and fast-growing companies. A team’s members also need strong support to cope with the requirements and workload of managing a fund. Saminvest pays great attention to the degree of gender equality of a fund’s management team. One of Saminvest’s strategic goals is for women to make up 40-60% of the teams managing the investment funds it works with by the end of 2026. Teams are defined as partners, investment managers, and senior investment analysts. Investment funds that have too few or no women are recommended to develop a clear plan for how the proportion of women will increase as the team is formed and the fund grows. Strategy The strategy for a fund must be feasible. The fund’s investment focus should be on innovative and growing companies. The strategy should also include what phases of development the fund will target for the companies it intends to invest in, as well as the geographical concentration of the investments. The capital allocation plan, i.e., how you intend to distribute the investment amounts in size and over time, must be in line with the team’s strategy for value creation. The business flow must be relevant, large enough, and of sufficiently high quality to build a diversified portfolio. Value creation is what the team intends to add to a company as an investor, i.e., everything from technical know-how to sales and marketing or recruitment skills. Saminvest attaches great importance to whether the team intends to provide the companies with sustainability expertise. As active investors, the management team is expected to have a running dialogue with their respective portfolio companies regarding the management of risks and opportunities in terms of sustainability, with a significant impact on the company’s conditions for success. Market opportunity The market opportunities must be realistic and harmonize with the fund’s size and strategy. The fund’s focus must therefore be neither too broad nor too narrow. Saminvest carefully analyses an investment to ensure that it supplements the market from a capital needs perspective, i.e., that there is a real need for financing by the companies in which the fund intends to invest. In addition, too many funds with a similar focus often lead to high valuations and a low or negative return on invested capital in the long run. Fund parameters In order for Saminvest to invest in a fund, the fund’s size, budget, fees, and terms must be well-defined and balanced. Above all, they must be market-based for the fund to be able to attract private capital. In addition, the fund must have its legal base of operation in Sweden. Saminvest only has the opportunity to account for a small part of the fund’s total size. Therefore, a thorough plan for raising capital is required to assess the probability of the fund receiving sufficient financing. Unrealistic plans for raising capital are one of the most common reasons why Saminvest chooses to refrain from investing in a fund. Content from investment-process.md Title: Investment process URL Source: https://www.saminvest.se/en/investment-process/ Markdown Content: We treat all investment proposals equally and evaluate them all with the same analysis model. In cases where applications do not result in investment, we provide clear feedback to the teams that submitted proposals. We want to give the teams managing the funds we work with full insight into what is required and expected. Therefore, it’s important to have clarity throughout the investment process. Every investment comes with the active participation of Saminvest. Our efforts can be the difference between whether a fund is formed or not. Our goal is to help the management team and provide the fund with support to raise enough capital. Our discussions with funds do not always result in an investment. Sometimes Saminvest’s anchor investment is not needed, but the fund can raise enough capital on its own. Sometimes the fund proposal does not meet our requirements. If that’s the case, we give detailed feedback so that the fund has the opportunity to adapt its strategy or change its structure and re-submit to us a new funding proposal at a later date. For questions about the process, please email [fundadmin@saminvest.se](mailto:fundadmin@saminvest.se). From proposal to investment --------------------------- Investment proposal submission: A proposal to invest in a fund is submitted via Saminvest’s website. Introductory meeting: After Saminvest has received the investment proposal, an introductory meeting is held to discuss the proposal. Thereafter, an initial assessment is made of whether the fund appears to meet Saminvest’s criteria and whether it would be interesting to invest in the fund. In-depth meeting: If the investment proposal meets Saminvest’s criteria and is deemed interesting, the fund team will be invited to present the fund structure to Saminvest. Due diligence: Saminvest meets the fund team to conduct a deeper evaluation of the fund. Prior to the meeting, the team is asked to fill out a questionnaire (DDQ - Due Diligence Questionnaire). Investment decision: Saminvest decides whether it should invest in the fund or not. Prior to the decision, a so-called “term sheet” is drawn up (document with main conditions) and background checks are made of the team’s most senior members. Agreement: Prior to an investment commitment, an investment agreement and any side agreement is signed. The agreements contain the terms that the fund’s management team and Saminvest agree on. Management and follow-up: Once the fund has started its operations, the management phase begins. During the fund’s lifetime, Saminvest monitors the fund’s development and participates in the fund’s advisory committee. Great emphasis is placed on the follow-up of sustainability issues.

The fund’s parameters (including the planned size of the fund), structure of the management company and the fund, its governance and decision-making process, and proposed terms. Market opportunities, including business flow, competition, and syndication partners. Strategy, including areas of focus with regard to geography and industries/sectors, capital allocation, expected return, and a plan for raising capital with a list of other investors. Content from sustainable-value-creation.md Title: Sustainable value creation URL Source: https://www.saminvest.se/en/sustainable-value-creation/ Markdown Content: In order to create long term and sustainable value creation an organization must consider and manage significant aspects of its operations and strategy. Saminvest should contribute to value creation in a way that promotes long-term sustainable development. This means that, in the light of the industry and the markets in which we operate, we seek to identify and minimise the risk of negative impacts of our operations, while also taking advantage of new business opportunities and innovative thinking for sustainable value creation. This includes both material sustainability issues and also digitalisation and systematic security work. Strategic targets for sustainable value creation ------------------------------------------------ The strategic goals for sustainable value creation should focus on creating value that is both sustainable and material. Saminvest has four strategic targets for creating sustainable value: 1\\. Complement the market Saminvest invests in funds that invest in companies that are active in industries and phases where private capital alone is not sufficiently available. 2\\. Develop the ecosystem for venture capital Saminvest should contribute to develop the Swedish eco system and the Swedish market for venture capital. This is achieved by, among other things, investing in new teams, encouraging, and investing together with private capital, advocating for an even distribution of women and men in funds’ investment organizations. We also monitor the proportion of our funds that report the impact of their investments on the UN sustainable development goals. 3\\. Vitalize Swedish entrepreneurship The capital that Saminvest invests is aiming to vitalize Swedish entrepreneurship. This is done by facilitating investing together with private capital in funds that invest in new innovative companies with a growth potential. 4\\. Preserve capital over time Over time, Saminvest should be a self-financed “evergreen” company, where returns can be reinvested in new funds and angel investor programs.

You can invest in unlisted growth companies within life science and health tech which have gone through our selection process. Text: Read more about our process for selecting companies., URL: https://sciety.com/investment-network/ Who can invest via Sciety? Everyone who resides within the EU/EEA and is older than 18, as well as companies registered with the EU/EEA are welcome to invest via Sciety. What are the risks involved in investing in a company at an early stage? Investments in early-stage companies provide the possibility of a high yield but also incur high risks. If the company fails, which is not uncommon, the investors most probably lose their invested capital. The company can also grow but without generating a significant yield for its shareholders. A third risk is that the company does not grow as expected and additional capital is required at a lower valuation. It is important to remember that 1) even successful early-stage companies rarely provide dividends as they need their capital for continued expansion and 2) finding a buyer when you want to sell your shares can be difficult (if the company is not listed). You can find more information about risks in our Text: risk policy, URL: https://sciety.com/sv/risk-warning/. Does Sciety provide investment advice? No. Sciety selects companies according to specific criteria but never gives advice or recommendations on investment in a given company. Decisions about which companies to invest in are entirely your own. How does Sciety select companies? Sciety monitors the industry and also receives a large number of inquiries from companies who are looking for financing. We first compile the information required, followed by a commercial assessment of the companies. The companies that pass this stage are then reviewed on a legal basis. Keep in mind that our assessments should never be seen as investment advice or as recommendations to invest in a certain company. If you choose to invest you are entirely responsible for your own investment decision Is Sciety a party in the investments? Sciety is not a party in the investments made by Sciety Venture Partners; however, Sciety invests own funds in every company we select, on the same terms as the members of Sciety Venture Partners. Our primary role is to facilitate transactions between the companies and investors in connection to new share issues. How much do your services cost me as an investor? There are no costs for you as an investor. The companies we invest in are charged a fee. Am I entitled to tax relief/investor deductions? If you are liable for taxation in Sweden and both you and the company you invest in meet the Swedish Tax Agency’s criteria, your share purchase may entitle you to tax relief. For more information, please refer to the Text: Swedish Tax Agency, URL: https://www.skatteverket.se/privat/skatter/vardepapper/investeraravdrag.4.10cbb69314111c2d94ba38b.html. About investing with Sciety --------------------------- How do I pay for my shares? Payment details are sent to you via email after you have registered your investment. You can also find the information if you download your settlement note directly under My Account / My Investments. You pay via bankgiro to Sciety’s client funds account with SEB where the funds are held until the share issue is completed. We transfer the funds to the company only after we have checked to ensure that you are registered in the company’s share register. If the share issue conditions are not met, we transfer the funds back to your bank account. Please be aware of any fake emails you receive in Sciety’s name. How does Sciety handle payments for the shares? Payments for shares are held in our client funds account at SEB. This means that your money will be protected even in the unlikely event that Sciety goes bankrupt. We only transfer the money to the company you’ve invested in if the terms of the issue are met. Otherwise, we will refund the money to your bank account. Sciety is authorised by Finansinspektionen (the Swedish government authority tasked with monitoring the financial market) to handle client funds. Will I get a receipt for my payment? Yes, you will receive a confirmation via email when we have received your payment. Please note that we receive payment details from the bank in the afternoon on the following weekday. Why do I need to verify my identity? Verifying your identity is a part of our controls against money laundering and financing of terrorism. Identity verification is an important step in protecting you and your co-investors, as well as the company in which you are investing, from illegal actions. What is the minimum amount I can invest? The minimum amount is determined by the respective companies in consultation with Sciety. The amount is usually between SEK 100 000 and SEK 500 000. Can I change my mind about an investment? Yes, if you invest as a private person you have the right to change your mind within 14 days after you registered to invest through our website. This is in accordance with the Act on Distance Contracts and Off-Premises Contracts. For more information, please contact our [support](mailto:support@sciety.se). What happens after I have invested? When the share issue is completed, remaining payments are collected and Sciety carries out checks in accordance with The Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Prevention) Act. The shareholder agreement is then sent out for signature and the shares are allotted. You will then receive a confirmation of your share ownership. Usually, the companies send out information updates to you as a shareholder every quarter or every six months. Do I receive a share certificate? The legal proof of your share ownership can be found in the respective company’s share register. Normally, the companies maintain the share register digitally, which gives you the opportunity to log in yourself and see your holdings via the service that the companies use. After completion of the issue, you will receive information about which service the company you invested in uses.

Long-term demand An aging population, increasing incidence of lifestyle diseases, and more demanding health care consumers are increasing demand for drugs, innovative medical technology, and digital solutions.

This in turn leads to increased demand for precision diagnostics and technology solutions in areas such as genomics. Growth companies on top Growth companies in the biopharma sector are behind the majority of all new drugs approved by the FDA. Increasing numbers of partnership agreements are also being signed between Big Pharma and smaller companies. More tech in healthcare Digital solutions are being implemented at a fast pace.

Our philosophy is that impact and financial return should go hand in hand. What guides us in handpicking our portfolio companies is their potential to make an impact in their respective industries. We invest alongside the investor network Sciety Venture Partners and frequently co-invest with leading life science venture capital firms in Europe. We know the Nordic life science industry ---------------------------------------- At Sciety, we operate at the heart of the Nordic life science industry. Our expertise and connections span from the ground up, encompassing the companies that lead the charge as well as the pioneering researchers at the top universities. Our insights about the evolving life science field offer a window into future directions and potential benchmarks.

Linc has invested in several unlisted life science companies together with Sciety.” Bengt Julander, founder of Linc Advanced tech solutions At the core of our operations lies what we refer to as our foundational infrastructure — consisting of cutting-edge digital technologies and intelligent systems design, which many industry experts acknowledge as unprecedented. Our foundational infrastructure is built to handle a high volume of data and transactions smoothly and efficiently.

We track and analyse the progression of companies, leveraging advanced systems to maintain a comprehensive overview.

When you partner with us we’re all in. We bring everything we’ve learned, everyone we know, and every resource at our disposal. Consider us an extension of your team. About TVP --------- Tribeca Venture Partners works with entrepreneurs primarily in the New York area leveraging emerging technologies and business models to create and disrupt huge markets. Founded in 2011 by long-time NY VC’s Brian Hirsch and Chip Meakem, our team has over 25 years’ experience operating and investing in New York tech. Investment Philosophy ----------------------- We invest in people first, second and third. People that inspire us and inspire those around them. People with the passion and obsession to see their vision through to the end no matter the obstacles. Successful venture investing at the early stage is about big ideas that create big outcomes for the company and its investors. We’re looking to partner with founders looking to put a dent in the universe. As such, we only partner with founders when we believe their company alone can return our entire fund or more. The truth is there aren’t that many companies that meet that criteria, so we only invest in a handful of companies each year. This allows us to focus all of our time and energy on each and every one of our companies. We want to help you make the dent as large as possible. By the way, we’re wrong all the time. It’s part of the gig. So if we say no, it’s nothing personal, and just know that we raise capital too, and we’ve been rejected many times before. Not everyone has the same vision of the future – and that’s ok. Why We’re Different ------------------- ### We’re NY-Focused We believe in the power of the NY tech market and have been operating and investing here since 1995. We’re primarily Series A lead investors in NY companies with an occasional seed investment. We work closely with industry leaders and the community to continue to build and grow the NY tech ecosystem. ### We’re purposely selective, deeply committed, and do the work We’re a small firm and are very selective with our investments (5-6 per year or ~20 per fund). So you really matter. You have full access to our partners and all our resources. We always show up, put in the time and do the work to help you fulfill your vision for the future. Our founders tell us we’re typically their first call to get advice, work through a problem or get an extra set of hands to accomplish an important task. ### We believe in intellectual honesty Direct, open, and honest conversations are the fastest way to address problems and the best pathway to success. With us, there is no positioning, no BS, and we bring high conviction. We’re always up for a challenge and are not afraid to address the elephant in the room. ### We’re entrepreneurs, too We know how to create the critical building blocks for success and have the process, people, and community to deliver. Investment Criteria --------------------- Text: View Our Portfolio, URL: https://tribecavp.com/companies/ Stage Through two separate funds, we invest in both early and later stage companies. We typically lead or co-lead early stage investments in companies post product launch where we can get early market feedback from customers or users. For later stage companies, we back complete management teams in companies at a ~$20M+ annual revenue run-rate and above. Flexibility is the key in our later stage investments. We tailor the round to the needs of the company without artificial constraints like minimum check size or minimum ownership and will consider secondary opportunities as part of our later stage investment focus. Sector Many of the most successful start-ups in history created their own new sector. So our favorite “sector” is a tight founding team applying technology to the confluence of macro trends to create or disrupt a big market. With that said, we’ve had a lot of success backing teams in SaaS, marketplaces, fintech and martech but we like to keep our aperture as wide open as possible. It’s a golden age of technology right now, and we are all lucky to be living through it. There’s not a corner of the economy or any industry that will not be transformed by technology over the next twenty years. Geography Mostly New York because it’s one of the fastest-growing markets and second largest market in the U.S. for innovation. We’ve also spent our careers building companies here and can maximize our value to entrepreneurs by being nearby. We go to board meetings…yes…but it’s more about jumping on the subway and working the whiteboard together. Having said that, we have ventured out occasionally (cheesy pun intended) with companies in Boston, DC, Research Triangle Park, and SF. We currently do not invest in companies based outside of the United States. Investment Size Initial check sizes of $1 to $6 million if you’re early and we find ourselves typically leading rounds of $3 to $15 million in size. For growth stage companies, we typically write checks of $5 to $10 million in rounds of any size.
